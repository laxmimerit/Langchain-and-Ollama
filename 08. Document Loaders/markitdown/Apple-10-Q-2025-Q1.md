Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

Apple Inc.

Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Apple  Inc.  and  its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries
(collectively  “Apple”  or  the  “Company”).  In  the  opinion  of  the  Company’s  management,  the  condensed  consolidated  financial
statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation.
The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted  accounting  principles  (“GAAP”)  requires  the  use  of  management estimates.  These  condensed  consolidated  financial
statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements
and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 (the “2024
Form 10-K”).

The  Company’s  fiscal  year  is  the  52-  or  53-week  period  that  ends  on  the  last  Saturday  of  September.  An  additional  week  is
included  in  the  first  fiscal  quarter  every  five  or  six  years  to  realign  the  Company’s  fiscal  quarters  with  calendar  quarters.  The
Company’s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters,
months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of
those fiscal years.

Note 2 – Revenue

Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30,
2023 were as follows (in millions):

iPhone®
Mac®
iPad®

Total net sales include $3.7 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 28, 2024 that was included in
deferred  revenue  as  of September  28,  2024  and  $3.5  billion  of  revenue  recognized  in  the  three  months  ended December  30,
2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023.

The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment
in  Note  10,  “Segment  Information  and  Geographic  Data”  for  the  three  months  ended  December  28,  2024  and  December  30,
2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.

As of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.2 billion and $12.8 billion,
respectively. As of December 28, 2024, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year,
25% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.

(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally
have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant
inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

(2) As  of  December  28,  2024  and  September  28,  2024,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  included  $126  million  and  $2.6  billion,
respectively, held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted cash and cash equivalents are designated to
settle the Company’s obligation related to the 2016 European Commission (the “Commission”) decision that Ireland granted
state aid to the Company (the “State Aid Decision”), which was confirmed during the fourth quarter of 2024 by the European
Court of Justice in a reversal of the 2020 judgment of the European General Court.

(3) As  of  December  28,  2024  and  September  28,  2024,  current  marketable  securities  included  $3.3  billion  and  $13.2  billion,
respectively, held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted marketable securities are designated to settle
the Company’s obligation related to the State Aid Decision.

As  of  December  28,  2024,  85%  of  the  Company’s  non-current  marketable  debt  securities  other  than  mortgage-  and  asset-
backed  securities  had  maturities  between  1  and  5  years, 11%  between  5  and  10  years,  and 4%  greater  than  10  years. As  of
December 28, 2024, 13% of the Company’s non-current mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5
years, 10% between 5 and 10 years, and 77% greater than 10 years.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations
or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a
portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To  protect  gross  margins  from  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  the  Company  may  use  forwards,  options  or  other
instruments,  and  may  designate  these  instruments  as  cash  flow  hedges.  The  Company  generally  hedges  portions  of  its
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To  protect  the  Company’s  foreign  currency–denominated  term  debt  or  marketable  securities  from  fluctuations  in  foreign
exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these
instruments  as  either  cash  flow  or  fair  value  hedges.  As  of  December  28,  2024,  the  maximum  length  of  time  over  which  the
Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 18
years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from
certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by
the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest
rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024
were as follows (in millions):

Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

As of December 28, 2024, the Company had two customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables,
which  accounted  for  18%  and  11%.  The  Company’s  third-party  cellular  network  carriers  accounted  for  33%  and  38%  of  total
trade  receivables  as  of  December  28,  2024  and  September  28,  2024,  respectively.  The  Company  requires  third-party  credit
support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The  Company  has  non-trade  receivables  from  certain  of  its  manufacturing  vendors  resulting  from  the  sale  of  components  to
these  vendors  who  manufacture  subassemblies  or  assemble  final  products  for  the  Company.  The  Company  purchases  these
components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather,
the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are
sold by the Company. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of
total  vendor  non-trade  receivables,  which  accounted  for  43%  and  24%.  As  of  September  28,  2024,  the  Company  had  two
vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.

Item 2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within
the  meaning  of  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995,  that  involve  risks  and  uncertainties.  Forward-looking
statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does
not  directly  relate  to  any  historical  or  current  fact.  For  example,  statements  in  this  Form  10-Q  regarding  the  potential  future
impact  of  macroeconomic  conditions  on  the  Company’s  business  and  results  of  operations  are  forward-looking  statements.
Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,”
“intends,”  “plans,”  “predicts,”  “will,”  “would,”  “could,”  “can,”  “may,”  and  similar  terms.  Forward-looking  statements  are  not
guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the
forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,
Item  1A  of  the  2024  Form  10-K  and  Part  II,  Item  1A  of  this  Form  10-Q,  in  each  case  under  the  heading  “Risk  Factors.”  The
Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  information  presented  herein  is  based  on  the  Company’s  fiscal  calendar,  and  references  to
particular  years,  quarters,  months  or  periods  refer  to  the  Company’s  fiscal  years  ended  in  September  and  the  associated
quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission  (the  “SEC”)  and  the  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  included  in  Part  I,
Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Available Information

The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor
relations  website,  investor.apple.com.  This  includes  press  releases  and  other  information  about  financial  performance,
information  on  environmental,  social  and  governance  matters,  and  details  related  to  the  Company’s  annual  meeting  of
shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this
filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in
part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of
sales  and  operating  expenses.  The  timing  of  product  introductions  can  also  impact  the  Company’s  net  sales  to  its  indirect
distribution  channels  as  these  channels  are  filled  with  new  inventory  following  a  product  launch,  and  channel  inventory  of  an
older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and
distributors anticipate a product introduction.

During the first quarter of 2025, the Company announced the following product updates:

• MacBook Pro®
• Mac mini®
iMac®
•
iPad mini®
•

Macroeconomic Conditions

Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and
could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to
a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, the impact of foreign currency loss
regulations  issued  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury  in  December  2024,  and  the  tax  impact  from  foreign  currency
revaluations related to the State Aid Decision.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to
the  impact  of  foreign  currency  loss  regulations  issued  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury  in  December  2024  and  the  tax
impact  from  foreign  currency  revaluations  related  to  the  State  Aid  Decision,  partially  offset  by  a  higher  effective  tax  rate  on
foreign earnings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company believes its balances of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash generated
by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return
program over the next 12 months and beyond.

The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2024 Form 10-K, except for commercial
paper, manufacturing purchase obligations and the State Aid Decision tax payable.

Commercial Paper

The  Company  issues  unsecured  short-term  promissory  notes  pursuant  to  a  commercial  paper  program.  As  of  December  28,
2024, the Company had $2.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which was payable within 12 months.

Manufacturing Purchase Obligations

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform
final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide
variety of individual suppliers. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $39.8 billion,
which were payable within 12 months.

State Aid Decision Tax Payable

During  the  first  quarter  of  2025,  the  Company  paid  €11.0  billion  or  $11.9  billion  to  Ireland  in  connection  with  the  State  Aid
Decision.  As  of  December  28,  2024,  the  Company  had  a  remaining  obligation  to  pay  €3.3  billion  or  $3.4  billion,  which  was
expected  to  be  paid  within  12  months.  The  funds  necessary  to  settle  the  remaining  obligation  were  held  in  escrow  as  of
December 28, 2024, and restricted from general use.

Capital Return Program

In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does
not  obligate  the  Company  to  acquire  a  minimum  amount  of  shares.  As  of December  28,  2024,  the  Company’s  quarterly  cash
dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the
Board of Directors.

During the first quarter of 2025, the Company repurchased $23.3 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend
equivalents of $3.9 billion.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses

In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.
2024-03,  Income  Statement—Reporting  Comprehensive  Income—Expense  Disaggregation  Disclosures  (Subtopic  220-40):
Disaggregation  of  Income  Statement  Expenses  (“ASU  2024-03”)  and  in  January  2025,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2025-01,
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the
Effective Date, which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03. ASU 2024-03 will require the Company to disclose the amounts
of  purchases  of  inventory,  employee  compensation,  depreciation  and  intangible  asset  amortization,  as  applicable,  included  in
certain  expense  captions  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations,  as  well  as  qualitatively  describe  remaining  amounts
included  in  those  captions.  ASU  2024-03  will  also  require  the  Company  to  disclose  both  the  amount  and  the  Company’s
definition of selling expenses. The Company will adopt ASU 2024-03 in its fourth quarter of 2028 using a prospective transition
method.

Income Taxes

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
(“ASU 2023-09”), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation
and  provide  additional  information  for  reconciling  items  that  meet  a  quantitative  threshold.  ASU  2023-09  will  also  require  the
Company  to  disaggregate  its  income  taxes  paid  disclosure  by  federal,  state  and  foreign  taxes,  with  further  disaggregation
required  for  significant  individual  jurisdictions.  The  Company  will  adopt  ASU  2023-09  in  its  fourth  quarter  of  2026  using  a
prospective transition method.

Segment Reporting

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment

provided  to  the  Company’s  chief  operating  decision  maker  (“CODM”).  In  addition,  ASU  2023-07  will  require  the  Company  to
disclose  the  title  and  position  of  its  CODM  and  how  the  CODM  uses  segment  profit  or  loss  information  in  assessing  segment
performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a
retrospective transition method.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  and  related  disclosures  in  conformity  with  GAAP  and  the  Company’s  discussion  and
analysis  of  its  financial  condition  and  operating  results  require  the  Company’s  management  to  make  judgments,  assumptions

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined
in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Exchange  Act  were  effective  as  of  December  28,  2024  to  provide  reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
(i)  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and
(ii)  accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company’s  management,  including  its  principal  executive  officer  and  principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There  were  no  changes  in  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  during  the first  quarter  of  2025,  which  were
identified  in  connection  with  management’s  evaluation  required  by  paragraph  (d)  of  Rules  13a-15  and  15d-15  under  the
Exchange  Act,  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  the  Company’s  internal  control  over
financial reporting.

Item 1.

Legal Proceedings

Digital Markets Act Investigations

On  March  25,  2024,  the  Commission  announced  that  it  had  opened  two  formal  noncompliance  investigations  against  the
Company under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article
5(4)  of  the  DMA,  which  relates  to  how  developers  may  communicate  and  promote  offers  to  end  users  for  apps  distributed
through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA,
which  relates  to  default  settings,  uninstallation  of  apps,  and  a  web  browser  choice  screen  on  iOS.  On  June  24,  2024,  the
Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are
in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the
Company’s  new  contractual  requirements  for  third-party  app  developers  and  app  marketplaces  may  violate  the  DMA.  If  the
Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose
fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the
General  Court  of  the  EU,  the  effectiveness  of  the  Commission’s  order  would  apply  immediately  while  the  appeal  is  pending,
unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes
to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.

Department of Justice Lawsuit

On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil
antitrust  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  New  Jersey  against  the  Company  alleging  monopolization  or
attempted  monopolization  in  the  markets  for  “performance  smartphones”  and  “smartphones”  in  violation  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws.
The  DOJ  is  seeking  equitable  relief  to  redress  the  alleged  anticompetitive  behavior.  In  addition, various  civil  litigation  matters
have  been  filed  in  state  and  federal  courts  in  the  U.S.  alleging  similar  violations  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws  and  seeking  monetary
damages  and  other  nonmonetary  relief.  The  Company  believes  it  has  substantial  defenses  and  intends  to  vigorously  defend
itself.

Epic Games

Epic  Games,  Inc.  (“Epic”)  filed  a  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of  California  (the  “California  District
Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based
upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App
Store  Review  Guidelines  violate  California’s  unfair  competition  law  and  issued  an  injunction  enjoining  the  Company  from
prohibiting  developers  from  including  in  their  apps  external  links  that  direct  customers  to  purchasing  mechanisms  other  than
Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS® App Store. On January
16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California
District  Court.  A  motion  by  Epic  disputing  the  Company’s  compliance  plan  and  seeking  to  enforce  the  injunction,  which  the
Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with
the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to
vigorously defend itself.

Other Legal Proceedings

The  Company  is  subject  to  other  legal  proceedings  and  claims  that  have  not  been  fully  resolved  and  that  have  arisen  in  the
ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in
the  aggregate  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s  financial  condition  or  operating  results.  The  outcome  of  litigation  is
inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above
management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 18

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of
factors,  whether  currently  known  or  unknown,  including  those  described  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  the  2024  Form  10-K  under  the
heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation,
results  of  operations,  financial  condition  and  stock  price  can  be  materially  and  adversely  affected.  Except  as  set  forth  below,
there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K.

The  Company  is  subject  to  complex  and  changing  laws  and  regulations  worldwide,  which  exposes  the  Company  to
potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.

The  Company’s  global  operations  are  subject  to  complex  and  changing  laws  and  regulations  on  subjects  including  antitrust;
privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services
and  technology;  product  liability;  intellectual  property  ownership  and  infringement;  digital  platforms;  machine  learning  and
artificial  intelligence;  internet,  telecommunications  and  mobile  communications;  media,  television,  film  and  digital  content;
availability  of  third-party  software  applications  and  services;  labor  and  employment;  anticorruption;  import,  export  and  trade;
foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; national
security; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.

Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders,
directives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting
the  Company’s  ability  to  offer  a  product,  service  or  feature  to  customers,  imposing  changes  to  the  design  of  the  Company’s
products  and  services,  impacting  customer  demand  for  the  Company’s  products  and  services,  and  requiring  changes  to  the
Company’s  business  or  supply  chain.  New  and  changing  laws,  regulations,  executive  orders,  directives,  and  enforcement
priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.

Risks  and  costs  related  to  new  and  changing  laws,  regulations,  executive  orders,  directives,  and  enforcement  priorities  may
increase  as  the  Company’s  products  and  services  are  introduced  into  specialized  applications,  including  health  and  financial
services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and
must  navigate  new  legal,  regulatory  and  ethical  considerations  relating  to  such  technologies.  The  Company  has  implemented
policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the
Company’s  employees,  contractors  or  agents  will  not  violate  such  laws  and  regulations  or  the  Company’s  policies  and
procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s
business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or
no  advance  notice  and  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to  effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  For
example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company
has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance
that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s
products  could  be  banned,  delayed  or  prohibited  from  importation,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company’s
business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory
scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.

From  time  to  time,  the  Company  has  made  changes  to  its  App  Store,  including  actions  taken  in  response  to  litigation,
competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes
in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers
within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.

The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the
DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution
for  iOS  and  iPadOS  apps,  alternative  payment  processing  for  apps  across  the  Company’s  operating  systems,  and  additional
tools and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its
compliance  plan  in  response  to  feedback  and  engagement  with  the Commission.  Although  the  Company’s  compliance  plan  is
intended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private
litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the
Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new
privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.

Apple Inc. | Q1 2025 Form 10-Q | 19

The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can
result  in  legal  proceedings  and  claims  against  the  Company  that  could,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  have  a  materially
adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject
to  civil  antitrust  lawsuits  in  the  U.S.  alleging  monopolization  or  attempted  monopolization  in  the  markets  for  “performance
smartphones”  and  “smartphones”  generally  in  violation  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws.  In  addition,  the  Company  is  the  subject  of
investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are
resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes
to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations
and financial condition.

Further,  the  Company  has  commercial  relationships  with  other  companies  in  the  technology  industry  that  are  or  may  become
subject  to  investigations  and  litigation  that,  if  resolved  against  those  other  companies,  could  materially  adversely  affect  the
Company’s  commercial  relationships  with  those  business  partners  and  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company’s  business,
results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google
LLC (“Google”) and other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of
these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024, Google was
found  to  have  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws.  In  connection  with  this  finding,  the  DOJ  has  proposed  remedies,  which  include
changes to Google’s products, services and business models. The proposed changes vary in scope and severity and range from
imposing significant restrictions on Google’s licensing agreements to prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial
terms for search distribution for up to 10 years. If implemented, such remedies could materially adversely affect the Company’s
ability to earn revenue from such licensing arrangements.

There can be no assurance the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially adversely
affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in
the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other
legal  proceedings  can  negatively  impact  the  reputation  of  the  Company’s  products  for  privacy  and  security  and  otherwise
adversely  affect  the  experience  for  users  of  the  Company’s  products  and  services,  and  result  in  harm  to  the  Company’s
reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, lost sales, and
lower profit margins.

APPLE INC.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
(As Amended as of November 6, 2024)

This  Apple  Inc.  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (as  it  may  be  amended  from  time  to
time, the “Plan”) as amended and restated on March 10, 2015 (the “Effective Date”) and
as  further  amended  by  the  Board  on  November  6,  2024  shall  govern  all  grants  of
Options as to which Shares are to be delivered under the Plan.

(1) Purpose  of  the  Plan.    The  purpose  of  the  Plan  is  to  encourage  and  enable
Eligible  Employees  of  the  Company  and  certain  of  its  Subsidiaries  to  acquire
proprietary interests in the Company through the ownership of Shares.  It is the
intention of the Company to have this Plan and the Options granted pursuant to
this  Plan  satisfy  the  requirements  for  “employee  stock  purchase  plans”  that  are
set  forth  under  Section  423  of  the  Code,  although  the  Company  makes  no
undertaking to, nor representation that it will, maintain the qualified status of this
Plan  or  such  Options.    In  addition,  Options  that  do  not  satisfy  the  requirements
for “employee stock purchase plans” that are set forth under Section 423 of the
Code may be granted under this Plan pursuant to the rules, procedures, or sub-
plans adopted by the Board for Eligible Employees.

the course of employment.  Eligible Compensation shall be limited to
amounts  received  by  the  Participant  during  the  period  he  or  she  is
participating  in  the  Plan  and  includes  salary  and  other  wages,
amounts contributed by the Participant to any benefit plan maintained

pay,  commissions,  draws  against  commissions,  shift  premiums,  sick

extent  that  the  exclusion  of  any  such  item  (or  a  sub-set  of  any  such

does  not  include  any  incentive  or  other  bonus  payments  (unless  the
inclusion  of  any  incentive  or  other  bonus  payment  is  specifically
directed by the Administrator for all Eligible Employees), remuneration
paid  in  a  form  other  than  cash,  fringe  benefits  (including  car
allowances  and  relocation  payments),  employee  discounts,  expense
reimbursement or allowances, long-term disability payments, worker’s

pursuant  to  which  an  Eligible  Employee  elects  to  participate  in  this

the  agreement(s)  between

Plan or elects to make changes with respect to such participation as
permitted by this Plan.

(l) “Enrollment Period” shall mean that period of time prescribed by the
Administrator, which period shall conclude prior to the Offering Date,
during  which  Eligible  Employees  may  elect  to  participate  in  an
Offering  Period.    The  duration  and  timing  of  Enrollment  Periods  may
be changed or modified by the Administrator from time to time.

(m) “Fair  Market  Value”  shall  mean,  unless  otherwise  determined  or
provided  by  the  Administrator  in  the  circumstances,  the  closing  price
(in  regular  trading)  for  a  Share  of  Common  Stock  on  the  NASDAQ
Stock Market (the “Market”) for the date in question or, if no sales of
Common  Stock  were  reported  on  the  Market  on  that  date,  the  last
price (in regular trading) for a Share of Common Stock on the Market
for  the  next  preceding  day  on  which  sales  of  Common  Stock  were
reported  on  the  Market.    The  Administrator  may,  however,  provide
with respect to one or more Options that the Fair Market Value shall
equal  the  last  price  for  a  Share  of  Common  Stock  on  the  Market  on
the last Trading Day preceding the date in question or the average of
the  high  and  low  trading  prices  of  a  Share  of  Common  Stock  on  the
Market for the date in question or the most recent Trading Day.  If the
Common  Stock  is  no  longer  listed  or  is  no  longer  actively  traded  on
the  Market  as  of  the  applicable  date,  the  Fair  Market  Value  of  the
Common  Stock  shall  be  the  value  as  reasonably  determined  by  the
Administrator  for  purposes  of  the  Plan  in  the  circumstances.    The
Administrator also may adopt a different methodology for determining
Fair  Market  Value  with  respect  to  one  or  more  Options  if  a  different
methodology  is  necessary  or  advisable  to  secure  any  intended
favorable tax, legal, or other treatment for the particular Option(s) (for
example,  and  without  limitation,  the  Administrator  may  provide  that
Fair Market Value for purposes of one or more Options will be based
on an average of closing prices (or the average of high and low daily
trading prices) for a specified period preceding the relevant date).

(n) “Non-423(b) Offering” shall mean the rules, procedures, or sub-plans,
if any, adopted by the Administrator as a part of this Plan, pursuant to
which  Options  that  do  not  satisfy  the  requirements  for  “employee
stock  purchase  plans”  that  are  set  forth  under  Section  423  of  the
Code  may  be  granted  to  Eligible  Employees  as  a  separate  offering
under the Plan.

(3) Shares  Reserved  for  the  Plan.    Subject  to  adjustment  pursuant  to  Section  (17),
the  maximum  number  of  Shares  that  may  be  delivered  pursuant  to  Options
granted  under
this  Plan  (including  any  Non-423(b)  Offering  established
hereunder)  shall  equal  the  sum  of  (i)  50,000,000  Shares  and  (ii)  the  number  of
Shares  previously  reserved  for  issuance  under  the  Prior  Plan  but  not  delivered
pursuant to Options as of the Effective Date; provided that in no event shall the
maximum  number  of  Shares  reserved  for  issuance  under  the  Plan  exceed
57,591,146  Shares  (which  is  the  sum  of  (x)  the  50,000,000  Shares  set  forth
above, plus (y) the number of Shares available for issuance under the Prior Plan
on November 13, 2014).  The Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to this Plan
may be authorized but unissued Shares, treasury Shares, or Shares purchased
on the open market.  If any Option granted under the Plan shall for any reason
terminate without having been exercised, the Shares not purchased under such
Option shall again become available for issuance under the Plan.

If  the  number  of  Shares  to  be  purchased  by  Participants  on  the  last  day  of  an
Offering  Period  exceeds  the  total  number  of  Shares  then  available  under  the
Plan, then the Administrator shall make a pro-rata allocation of any Shares that
may be issued pursuant to the Plan in as uniform and equitable a manner as is
reasonably  practicable,  as  determined  in  the  Administrator’s  sole  discretion.    In
such event, the Company shall provide written notice to each affected Participant
of the reduction of the number of Shares to be purchased under the Participant’s
Option.

If the Administrator determines that some or all of the Shares to be purchased by
Participants  on  the  last  day  of  an  Offering  Period  would  not  be  issued  in
accordance with Applicable Laws or any approval by any regulatory body as may
be required, or the Shares would not be issued pursuant to an effective Form S-8
registration statement or that the issuance of some or all of such Shares pursuant

5

to  a  Form  S-8  registration  statement  is  not  advisable  due  to  the  risk  that  such
issuance will violate Applicable Laws, the Administrator may, without Participant
consent,  terminate  any  outstanding  Offering  Period  and  the  Options  granted
pursuant  thereto  and  refund  in  cash  all  affected  Participants’  entire  Account
balances for such Offering Period as soon as practicable thereafter.

In the Administrator’s discretion, fractional Shares may be issuable upon exercise
of the Options under the Plan.

(4) Administration  of  the  Plan.    The  Administrator  shall  have  the  authority  and
responsibility  for  the  day-to-day  administration  of  the  Plan,  which,  to  the  extent
permitted by the laws of the State of California and applicable U.S. Federal laws,
it  may  delegate  to  a  sub-committee.    Subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Plan,  the
Administrator shall have full authority, in its sole discretion, to take any actions it
deems  necessary  or  advisable  for  the  administration  of  the  Plan,  including,  but
not limited to:

(a) Interpreting  the  Plan  and  prescribing,  adopting,  and  rescinding  rules
and regulations it deems appropriate to implement the Plan, including
amending  any  outstanding  Option,  as  it  may  deem  advisable  or
necessary  to  comply  with  Applicable  Laws,  and  making  all  other
decisions relating to the operation of the Plan;

(b) Establishing the timing and length of Offering Periods;

(c) Establishing minimum and maximum contribution rates;

(d) Establishing new or changing existing limits on the number of Shares
an  Eligible  Employee  may  elect  to  purchase  with  respect  to  any
Offering Period, if such limits are announced prior to the first Offering
Period to be affected;

(e) Adopting  such  rules  or  sub-plans  as  may  be  deemed  necessary  or
appropriate  to  comply  with  the  laws  of  other  countries,  allow  for  tax-
preferred  treatment  of  the  Options  or  otherwise  provide  for  the
participation  by  Eligible  Employees  who  reside  outside  of  the  United
States, including determining which Eligible Employees are eligible to
participate  in  the  Non-423(b)  Offering  or  other  sub-plans  established
by the Administrator; and

(f) Establishing  the  exchange  ratio  applicable  to  amounts  withheld  in  a
currency other than U.S. dollars and permitting payroll withholding in
excess of the amount designated by a Participant in order to adjust for
delays or mistakes in the processing of properly completed Enrollment
Agreements.

The  Administrator’s  determinations  under  the  Plan  shall  be  final,
conclusive, and binding on all persons.  Neither the Board, the People
and  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board,  any  other  committee
appointed by the Board, nor any of their agents or designees shall be

6

liable  for  any  act,  failure  to  act,  or  determination  made  in  good  faith
with respect to the Plan.

(5) Grant of Option; Limitations.

(a) Grant  of  Option.    On  each  Offering  Date,  each  Participant  shall
automatically be granted an Option to purchase as many Shares (or,
as  applicable,  fractions  of  a  Share)  as  the  Participant  will  be  able  to
purchase  with  the  payroll  deductions  credited  to  the  Participant’s
Account during the applicable Offering Period.

(b) Limit on Number of Shares Purchased.  Notwithstanding the above, in
than  one  million
no  event  may  a  Participant  purchase  more
(1,000,000)  Shares  in  any  one  Offering  Period,  unless  otherwise
expressly  provided  by  the  Administrator  in  advance  of  that  Offering
Period.

(c) Limit on Value of Shares Purchased.  Notwithstanding any provisions
of the Plan to the contrary, excluding Options granted pursuant to any
Non-423(b)  Offering,  no  Participant  shall  be  granted  an  Option  to
purchase Shares under this Plan which permits the Participant’s rights
to  purchase  Shares  under  all
“employee  stock  purchase
plans” (described in Section 423 of the Code) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries  to  accrue  at  a  rate  which  exceeds  twenty-five  thousand
dollars ($25,000) of the Fair Market Value of such Shares (determined
at the time such Options are granted) for each calendar year in which
such Options are outstanding at any time.

(d) 5%  Owner  Limit.    Notwithstanding  any  provisions  of  the  Plan  to  the
contrary,  no  Participant  shall  be  granted  an  Option  to  purchase
Shares under this Plan if such Participant (or any other person whose
stock  would  be  attributed  to  such  Participant  pursuant  to  Section
424(d) of the Code), immediately after such Option is granted, would
own or hold options to purchase Shares possessing five percent (5%)
or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) Other Limitation.  The Administrator may determine, as to any Offering
Period, that the offering will not be extended to “highly compensated
employees” within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code.

(6) Participation in the Plan.  An Eligible Employee may become a Participant for an
Offering  Period  by  completing  the  prescribed  Enrollment  Agreement  and
submitting  such  Enrollment  Agreement  to  the  Company  (or  the  Company’s
designee),  in  the  format  and  pursuant  to  the  process  as  prescribed  by  the
Administrator,  during  the  Enrollment  Period  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the
Offering Period to which it relates.  Such Enrollment Agreement shall contain the
payroll  deduction  authorization  described  in  Section  (8).    A  payroll  deduction
authorization will be effective for the first Offering Period following the submission

7

of the Enrollment Agreement and all subsequent Offering Periods as provided by
Section (7) until (i) it is terminated in accordance with Sections (9) or (14), (ii) it is
modified by filing another Enrollment Agreement in accordance with this Section
(6),  (iii)  an  election  is  made  to  decrease  payroll  deductions  in  accordance  with
Section (8), (iv) the Participant’s Termination of Service, or (v) the Participant is
otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.

(7) Automatic  Re-Enrollment.    Following  the  end  of  each  Offering  Period,  each
Participant  shall  be  automatically  re-enrolled  in  the  next  Offering  Period  at  the
applicable rate of payroll deductions in effect on the last Trading Day of the prior
Offering  Period  or  otherwise  as  provided  under  Section  (8),  unless  (i)  the
Participant has elected to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section (9),
(ii)  the  Participant’s  Termination  of  Service,  or  (iii)  the  Participant  is  otherwise
ineligible  to  participate  in  the  next  Offering  Period.    Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  the  Administrator  may  require  current  Participants  to  complete  and
submit a new Enrollment Agreement at any time it deems necessary or desirable
to facilitate Plan administration or for any other reason.

(8) Payroll  Deductions.    Each  Participant’s  Enrollment  Agreement  shall  contain  a
payroll deduction authorization pursuant to which he or she shall elect to have a
designated  whole  percentage  of  Eligible  Compensation  between  one  percent
(1%) and ten percent (10%) deducted on each payday during the Offering Period
and credited to the Participant’s Account for the purchase of Shares pursuant to
the offering.  Payroll deductions shall commence on the Offering Date of the first
Offering  Period  to  which  the  Enrollment  Agreement  relates  (or  as  soon  as
administratively  practicable  thereafter)  and  shall  continue  through  subsequent
Offering  Periods  pursuant  to  Section  (7).    Participants  shall  not  be  permitted  to
make any separate cash payments into their Account for the purchase of Shares
pursuant  to  an  offering.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  local  law  prohibits
payroll  deductions,  a  Participant  may  elect  to  participate  in  an  Offering  Period
through contributions to his or her Account in a format and pursuant to a process
acceptable  to  the  Administrator.    In  such  event,  any  such  Participant  shall  be
deemed  to  participate  in  a  separate  offering  under  the  Plan,  unless  the
Administrator otherwise expressly provides.

If  in  any  payroll  period  a  Participant  has  no  pay  or  his  or  her  pay  is  insufficient
(after other authorized deductions) to permit deduction of the full amount of his or
her  payroll  deduction  election,  then  (i)  the  payroll  deduction  election  for  such
payroll  period  shall  be  reduced  to  the  amount  of  pay  remaining,  if  any,  after  all
other authorized deductions, and (ii) the percentage or dollar amount of Eligible
Compensation  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  reduced  by  the  amount  of  the
reduction in the payroll deduction election for such payroll period.  Deductions of
the full amount originally elected by the Participant will recommence as soon as
his or her pay is sufficient to permit such payroll deductions; provided, however,
no additional amounts will be deducted to satisfy the Outstanding Election.

A  Participant  may  elect  to  decrease,  but  not  increase,  the  rate  of  his  or  her
payroll  deductions  during  an  Offering  Period  by  submitting  the  prescribed
Enrollment Agreement to the Company (or the Company’s designee) at any time

8

prior to the first day of the last calendar month of such Offering Period.  Any such
payroll deduction change will be effective as soon as administratively practicable
thereafter and will remain in effect for successive Offering Periods as provided in
Section (7) unless (i) the Participant submits a new Enrollment Agreement for a
later  Offering  Period,  (ii)  the  Participant  elects  to  decrease  his  or  her  payroll
deductions,  (iii)  the  Participants  elects  to  withdraw  from  the  Plan  in  accordance
with  Section  (9),  (iv)  the  Participant  is  withdrawn  from  the  Plan  in  accordance
with Section (14), or (v) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the
Plan.  A Participant may only increase his or her rate of payroll deductions to be
effective for the next Offering Period by completing and filing with the Company a
new Enrollment Agreement authorizing the payroll deductions.

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Company  may  adjust  a  Participant’s  payroll
deductions  at  any  time  during  an  Offering  Period  to  the  extent  necessary  to
comply  with  Section  423(b)(8)  of  the  Code  and  the  limitations  of  Section  (5).
Payroll  deductions  will  recommence  and  be  made  in  accordance  with  the
Outstanding Election in place prior to such Company adjustment starting with the
first Offering Period that begins in the next calendar year (or such other time as is
determined  by  the  Administrator)  unless  (i)  the  Participant  withdraws  in
accordance  with  Section  (9),  (ii)  the  Participant  is  withdrawn  from  the  Plan  in
accordance  with  Section  (14),  or  (iii)  the  Participant  is  otherwise  ineligible  to
participate in the Plan.

(9) Withdrawal from Offering Period After Offering Date.  An Eligible Employee may
withdraw from any Offering Period after the applicable Offering Date, in whole but
not  in  part,  at  any  time  prior  to  the  date  specified  by  the  Administrator  or,  if  no
such date is specified by the Administrator, the last Trading Day of such Offering
Period,  by  submitting  the  prescribed  withdrawal  notice  to  the  Company  (or  the
Company’s  designee),  in  the  format  and  pursuant  to  the  process  as  prescribed
by  the  Administrator.    If  a  Participant  withdraws  from  an  Offering  Period,  the
Participant’s Option for such Offering Period will automatically be terminated, and
the Company will refund in cash the Participant’s entire Account balance for such
Offering Period as soon as practicable thereafter.  A Participant’s withdrawal from
a  particular  Offering  Period  shall  be  irrevocable.    If  a  Participant  wishes  to
participate in a subsequent Offering Period, he or she must re-enroll in the Plan
by timely submitting a new Enrollment Agreement in accordance with Section (6).

(10) Purchase  of  Stock.    On  the  last  Trading  Day  of  each  Offering  Period,  the
Administrator shall cause the amount credited to each Participant’s Account to be
applied  to  purchase  as  many  Shares  (or,  as  applicable,  fractions  of  a  Share)
pursuant to the Participant’s Option as possible at the Purchase Price Per Share,
subject  to  limitations  of  Sections  (3)  and  (5).    In  no  event  may  Shares  be
purchased pursuant to an Option more than twenty-seven (27) months after the
Offering Date of such Option.  The amount applied to purchase Shares pursuant
to  the  Option  shall  be  deducted  from  the  Participant’s  Account.    Any  amounts
remaining  credited  to  the  Participant’s  Account  on  the  last  Trading  Day  of  the
Offering Period shall be retained in the Participant’s Account and rolled forward
to the next Offering Period.

Interest  on  Payments.    No  interest  shall  be  paid  on  sums  withheld  from  a
Participant’s  pay  for  the  purchase  of  Shares  under  this  Plan  unless  otherwise
determined necessary by the Administrator.

(12) Rights as Shareholder.  A Participant will not be a shareholder or have any rights
as  a  shareholder  with  respect  to  Shares  subject  to  the  Participant’s  Options
issued  under  the  Plan  until  the  Shares  are  purchased  pursuant  to  the  Options
and  such  Shares  are  transferred  into  the  Participant’s  name  on  the  Company’s
books and records.

(13) Options  Not  Transferable.    A  Participant’s  Options  under  this  Plan  may  not  be
sold,  pledged,  assigned,  or  transferred  in  any  manner.    If  a  Participant  sells,
pledges, assigns, or transfers his or her Options in violation of this Section (13),
such  Options  shall  immediately  terminate,  and  the  Participant  shall  immediately
receive a refund of the amount then credited to the Participant’s Account.

(14) Deemed Cancellations.

(a) Termination of Service.  In the event of a Participant’s Termination of
Service,  (i)  any  outstanding  Option  held  by  the  Participant  shall
immediately terminate; (ii) the Participant shall be withdrawn from the
Plan; and (iii) the Participant shall receive a refund of the amount then
credited to the Participant’s Account.

(b) Death of a Participant.  If a Participant dies, (i) any outstanding Option
held  by  the  Participant  shall  immediately  terminate,  and  (ii)  the
Participant  shall  be  withdrawn
  As  soon  as
administratively  practicable  after  the  Participant’s  death,  the  amount
then  credited  to  the  Participant’s  Account  shall  be  remitted  to  the
executor,  administrator,  or  other
the
Participant’s  estate  or,  if  the  Administrator  permits  a  beneficiary
designation,  to  the  beneficiary  or  beneficiaries  designated  by  the
Participant if such designation has been filed with the Company or the
Company’s  designee  before  such  Participant’s  death.    If  such
executor,  administrator,  or  other
the
Participant’s estate has not been appointed (to the knowledge of the
Company) or if the beneficiary or beneficiaries are no longer living at
the time of the Participant’s death, the Company, in its discretion, may
deliver the outstanding Account balance to the spouse or to any one
or  more  dependents  or  relatives  of  the  Participant  or  to  such  other
person as the Company may designate.

(15) Application of Funds.  All funds received by the Company in payment for Shares
purchased under this Plan and held by the Company at any time may be used for
any valid corporate purpose.

(16) No  Employment/Service  Rights.    Neither  the  action  of  the  Company  in
establishing  the  Plan,  nor  any  action  taken  under  the  Plan  by  the  Board  or  the
Administrator,  nor  any  provision  of  the  Plan  itself,  shall  be  construed  so  as  to

10

grant  any  person  the  right  to  remain  in  the  employ  of  the  Company  or  any
Subsidiary  for  any  period  of  specific  duration,  and  such  person’s  employment
may be terminated at any time, with or without cause.

(17) Adjustments.    Subject  to  Section  (18),  upon  (or,  as  may  be  necessary  to  effect
the  adjustment,  immediately  prior  to)  any  reclassification,  recapitalization,  stock
split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split;
any  merger,  combination,  consolidation,  or  other  reorganization;  any  spin-off,
split-up,  or  similar  extraordinary  dividend  distribution  in  respect  of  the  Common
Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company or
any  similar,  unusual,  or  extraordinary  corporate  transaction  in  respect  of  the
Common  Stock,  in  each  case,  then  the  Administrator  shall  equitably  and
proportionately  adjust  (1)  the  number,  amount,  and  type  of  Shares  of  Common
Stock  (or  other  securities)  that  thereafter  may  be  made  the  subject  of  Options
(including the specific Share limits, maximums, and numbers of Shares set forth
elsewhere in the Plan), (2) the number, amount, and type of Shares of Common
Stock (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding Options, (3) the
Purchase Price Per Share of any outstanding Options, and/or (4) the securities,
cash, or other property deliverable upon exercise or payment of any outstanding
Options, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the
level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Options.

It  is  intended  that,  if  possible,  any  adjustments  contemplated  by  the  preceding
paragraph  be  made  in  a  manner  that  satisfies  applicable  legal,  tax  (including,
without  limitation  and  as  applicable  in  the  circumstances,  Section  424  of  the
Code  and  Section  409A  of  the  Code),  and  accounting  (so  as  to  not  trigger  any
charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.

Without limiting the generality of Section (4), any good faith determination by the
Administrator  as  to  whether  an  adjustment  is  required  in  the  circumstances
pursuant to this Section (17), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment,
shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons.

(18) Merger or Liquidation of Company.  In the event the Company or its shareholders
enter  into  an  agreement  to  dispose  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  assets  or
outstanding  capital  stock  of  the  Company  by  means  of  a  sale,  merger,  or
reorganization in which the Company will not be the surviving corporation (other
than  a  reorganization  effected  primarily  to  change  the  State  in  which  the
Company  is  incorporated,  a  merger  or  consolidation  with  a  wholly-owned
Subsidiary, or any other transaction in which there is no substantial change in the
shareholders  of  the  Company  or  their  relative  stock  holdings,  regardless  of
whether the Company is the surviving corporation) or in the event the Company
is  liquidated,  then  all  outstanding  Options  under  the  Plan  shall  automatically  be
exercised  immediately  prior  to  the  consummation  of  such  sale,  merger,
reorganization,  or  liquidation  (deemed  the  end  of  the  Offering  Period  in  such
case) by causing all amounts credited to each Participant’s Account to be applied
to purchase as many Shares pursuant to the Participant’s Option as possible at
the Purchase Price Per Share, subject to the limitations of Sections (3) and (5).

11

(19) Acquisitions  and  Dispositions.    The  Administrator  may,  in  its  sole  and  absolute
discretion  and  in  accordance  with  principles  under  Section  423  of  the  Code,
create  special  Offering  Periods  for  individuals  who  become  Eligible  Employees
solely  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  of  another  company  or  business  by
merger, reorganization, or purchase of assets, and notwithstanding Section (14),
may  provide  for  special  purchase  dates  for  Participants  who  will  cease  to  be
Eligible Employees solely in connection with the disposition of all or a portion of
any Designated Subsidiary or a portion of the Company, which Offering Periods
and  purchase  rights  granted  pursuant  thereto  shall,  notwithstanding  anything
stated  herein,  be  subject  to  such  terms  and  conditions  as  the  Administrator
considers appropriate in the circumstances.

(20) Government  Approvals  or  Consents.    This  Plan  and  any  offering  and  sales  of
Shares or delivery of Shares under this Plan to Eligible Employees hereunder are
subject to any governmental or regulatory approvals or consents that may be or
become applicable in connection therewith.

(21) Plan  Amendment,  Suspension,  and  Termination.    The  Board  may,  from  time  to
time, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan in any manner it deems necessary
or  advisable;  provided,  however,  that  no  such  action  shall  adversely  affect  any
then  outstanding  and  vested  Options  under  the  Plan  unless  such  action  is
required  to  comply  with  Applicable  Laws;  and  provided,  further,  that  no  such
action  of  the  Board  shall  be  effective  without  the  approval  of  the  Company’s
shareholders  if  such  approval  is  required  by  Applicable  Laws.    Upon  the
termination of the Plan, any balance in a Participant’s Account shall be refunded
to him or her as soon as practicable thereafter.

(22) Governing  Law.    The  Plan  shall  be  governed  by,  and  construed  in  accordance
with, the laws of the State of California (except its choice-of-law provisions) and
applicable U.S. Federal laws.

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN

(as amended November 6, 2024)

On  November  13,  2017,  the  Board  adopted  this  Non-Employee  Director  Stock  Plan  (formerly
known as the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan and the 1997 Director Stock Plan, and, as renamed, the
“Plan”), subject to approval by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual Meeting on February 13, 2018.
The  Plan  was  further  amended  by  the  Board  as  set  forth  herein,  effective  November  6,  2024.    For  the
terms and conditions of the Plan applicable to an Award, refer to the version of the Plan in effect as of the
date such Award was granted.

PURPOSES.  The purposes of the Plan are to retain the services of qualified individuals who are
1.
not  employees  of  the  Company  to  serve  as  members  of  the  Board  and  to  secure  for  the  Company  the
benefits of the incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such individuals by granting
such individuals Awards in respect of Shares.

ADMINISTRATION.  The Administrator shall be responsible for administering the Plan.  Subject
2.
to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have the full authority, in its sole discretion, to take
any actions it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, including but not limited to:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

determining the Fair Market Value for purposes of any Award;

approving any forms of Award Agreements to be used under the Plan;

amending any outstanding Awards;

construing and interpreting the Plan and any agreements defining the rights and

obligations of the Company and Non-Employee Directors under the Plan;

(e)

correcting any defect, supplying any omission or reconciling any inconsistency in

the Plan or any Award Agreement;

(f)

(g)

adopting such rules or guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan;

authorizing  any  person  to  execute  on  behalf  of  the  Company  any  instrument

required to effect the grant of an Award previously authorized by the Administrator or the Plan;

(h)

adjusting the number of shares subject to any Award, adjusting the price of any
or  all  outstanding  Options  or  otherwise  changing  previously  imposed  terms  and  conditions,  in
such circumstances as the Administrator may deem appropriate;

(i)

determining whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant

to Section 7 hereof; and

(j)

making all other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan.

Each  interpretation,  determination,  or  other  action  made  or  taken  by  the  Administrator  pursuant  to  the
Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, and the Administrator’s determinations under the Plan need
not  be  the  same  for  all  persons.    The  Administrator  shall  not  be  liable  for  any  action  or  determination
made in good faith, and shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement in the manner provided in
the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and  Bylaws as  such documents may be amended from time to
time.

3.

SHARES AVAILABLE; LIMITS.

(a)

SHARE LIMIT.  Subject to the provisions of Section 7, the maximum number of
Shares  that  may  be  issued  under  the  Plan  shall  not  exceed  11,200,000  Shares  (the  “Share
Limit”).  The stock issuable under the Plan shall be authorized and unissued Shares.

(b)

SHARE COUNT.  Shares issued pursuant to Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall
count against the Share Limit as two (2) Shares for every one (1) Share issued in connection with
the Award.  Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Options shall count against the Share Limit
as one (1) Share for every one (1) Share to which such exercise relates.  If Awards are settled in
cash, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no cash settlement shall not be
counted against the Share Limit.  Except as provided in the next sentence, if Awards are forfeited
or are terminated for any reason before settlement or exercise, then the Shares underlying such
Awards shall again become available for Awards under the Plan, provided that any one (1) Share
subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award that is forfeited or terminated shall be credited as two (2)
Shares  when  determining  the  number  of  Shares  that  shall  again  become  available  for  Awards
under  the  Plan.    Shares  that  are  exchanged  by  a  Non-Employee  Director  or  withheld  by  the
Company as full or partial payment in connection with any Award under the Plan, as well as any
Shares  exchanged  by  a  Non-Employee  Director  or  withheld  by  the  Company  or  one  of  its
Subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any Award, shall not be available
for subsequent Awards under the Plan.

(c)

LIMIT ON COMPENSATION.  In no event shall the compensation payable by the
Company  to  a  Non-Employee  Director  for  services  performed  as  a  Non-Employee  Director,
including the grant date value (determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles)
of Awards, cash retainers, and other compensation, exceed $1,500,000 in the aggregate in any
fiscal year.

4.
RESTRICTED  STOCK  UNITS.    Unless  otherwise  determined  by  the  Administrator,  each  Non-
Employee Director shall receive grants of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan subject to the following
provisions of this Section 4 and the terms of any Award Agreement approved by the Administrator:

(a)

ANNUAL GRANTS.  On the date of each Annual Meeting immediately following
which  a  Non-Employee  Director  is  serving  on  the  Board,  such  Non-Employee  Director  shall  be
automatically granted an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing (i)
$310,000 (or such other amount as determined by the Board and subject to the limitations of the
Plan) by (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, such number to be rounded
to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an “Annual RSU Award”).

(b)

INITIAL  GRANTS.    Each  Non-Employee  Director  who  first  becomes  a  Non-
Employee Director at any time other than on the date of an Annual Meeting shall be automatically
granted, on the date he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director, an Award of a number of
Restricted  Stock  Units  determined  by  multiplying  (i)  the  quotient  obtained  by  dividing  (A)  the
dollar  amount  applied  under  Section  4(a)  with  respect  to  Awards  granted  at  the  immediately
preceding Annual Meeting by (B) the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, by (ii)
a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the number of days remaining in the 365-day period
following the most recent Annual Meeting, and (B) the denominator of which shall be 365 (but in
no event shall such fraction be greater than one (1)), such number to be rounded to the nearest
whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an “Initial RSU Award”); provided, however, that a
Non-Employee Director shall not be eligible to receive an Initial RSU Award if either (x) he or she
was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to first becoming a
Non-Employee Director, or (y) he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time on or
after the February 1 following the last preceding Annual Meeting.

2

(c)

VESTING;  TERMINATION  OF  SERVICE.    Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  an
Award Agreement at the time of grant, each Annual RSU Award shall fully vest on the February 1
that  occurs  in  the  fiscal  year  of  the  Company  following  the  fiscal  year  in  which  the  Award  was
granted.  Each Initial RSU Award shall fully vest on the Vesting Date established for the Annual
RSU Awards granted in connection with the last Annual Meeting to occur prior to the grant date of
such Initial RSU Award.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board
for  any  reason  other  than  the  Non-Employee  Director’s  death,  the  Non-Employee  Director’s
Restricted Stock Units shall terminate to the extent such Restricted Stock Units have not become
vested prior to the first date the Non-Employee Director is no longer a member of the Board, and
the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to, or in respect of, such terminated
Restricted Stock Units.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board
due to his or her death, the Non-Employee Director’s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall fully
vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director’s death.

(d)

SETTLEMENT  OF  RESTRICTED  STOCK  UNITS.

  On  or  as  soon  as
administratively  practical  following  the  applicable  Vesting  Date  (and  in  all  events  not  later  than
two  and  one-half  months  after  the  applicable  Vesting  Date),  the  Company  shall  deliver  to  the
Non-Employee Director a number of Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books
of  the  Company  or  a  duly  authorized  transfer  agent  of  the  Company)  equal  to  the  number  of
Restricted  Stock  Units  that  vested  on  the  applicable  Vesting  Date.    Upon  settlement  of  any
Restricted  Stock  Units  in  accordance  with  the  foregoing  provision  of  this  Section  4(d)  and
settlement of any Dividend Equivalent Right in accordance with Section 4(f), the Non-Employee
Director shall have no further rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units that are so paid.

(e)

SHAREHOLDER  RIGHTS.    A  Non-Employee  Director  shall  have  no  rights  as  a
shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly set forth in Section 4(f) with
respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock
Units  or  any  Shares  underlying  or  issuable  in  respect  of  such  Restricted  Stock  Units  until  such
Shares have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 4(d).  Except for any
Dividend  Equivalent  Rights  awarded  pursuant  to  Section  4(f)  or  as  provided  in  Section  7,  no
adjustment shall be made in respect of any Restricted Stock Units for dividends or distributions or
other rights in respect of any share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the
Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record of Shares related thereto.

(f)

DIVIDEND  EQUIVALENT  RIGHTS  DISTRIBUTIONS.    As  of  any  date  that  the
Company  pays  an  ordinary  cash  dividend  on  its  Common  Stock,  the  Company  shall  credit  the
Non-Employee Directors with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per Share cash dividend paid by the
Company  on  its  Common  Stock  on  such  date,  multiplied  by  (ii)  the  total  number  of  Restricted
Stock Units (including as such total number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7) subject to the
Award  that  are  outstanding  immediately  prior  to  the  record  date  for  that  dividend  (a  “Dividend
Equivalent Right”).  Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions
of this Section 4(f) shall be subject  to  the same vesting, settlement and other terms, conditions
and  restrictions  as  the  Restricted  Stock  Units  to  which  they  relate;  provided,  however,  that  the
amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash.  No crediting of Dividend
Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 4(f) with respect to any Restricted Stock
Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant
to Section 4(d) or terminated pursuant to Section 4(c).

5.

OPTIONS.

(a)

NO ADDITIONAL GRANTS.  No Options shall be granted under the Plan unless
and until the Board determines that the grant of Options is in the best interests of the Company
and its shareholders.

3

(b)

EXERCISE PRICE.  The per share exercise price of each Option shall not be less
than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date of grant of the Option determined in
accordance with the provisions of the Plan.

(c)

VESTING.  Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement at the time of

grant, Options shall be fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant.

(d)

TERM OF OPTIONS.

i.

TEN-YEAR TERM.  Each Option shall expire ten (10) years from its date of grant,
subject to earlier termination as provided herein.

ii. TERMINATION  OF  SERVICE.    Upon  cessation  of  a  Non-Employee  Director’s
service  as  a  member  of  the  Board  for  any  reason  other  than  death,  any  of  the
Non-Employee Director’s Options (or any portion thereof) that is not then vested
shall terminate, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect
to,  or  in  respect  of,  such  terminated  Options.    If  the  Non-Employee  Director
ceases  to  serve  as  a  member  of  the  Board  due  to  his  or  her  death,  the  Non-
Employee Director’s Options shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee
Director’s death.

iii. EXERCISE  FOLLOWING  TERMINATIONS  OF  SERVICE.    If  a  Non-Employee
Director  ceases  to  be  a  member  of  the  Board  for  any  reason  other  than  death,
any Options granted to such Non-Employee Director that are exercisable at the
time of the Non-Employee Director’s termination may be exercised by such Non-
Employee Director at any time within ninety (90) days after the date of such Non-
Employee  Director’s  termination  of  service,  subject  to  the  earlier  expiration  of
such Options as provided for in Section 5(d)(i) above.  At the end of such ninety-
day  period,  any  unexercised  portion  of  the  Option  shall  expire.    If  a  Non-
Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board by reason of his or her
death, all of the Options granted to the Non-Employee Director may be exercised
by his or her Beneficiary at any time within three (3) years after the date of the
Non-Employee Director’s death, subject to the earlier expiration of such Options
as  provided  for  in  Section  5(d)(i)  above.    At  the  end  of  such  three-year  period,
any unexercised portion of the Option shall expire.

(e)

TIME AND MANNER OF EXERCISE OF OPTIONS.

i. NOTICE  OF  EXERCISE.    Subject  to  the  other  terms  and  conditions  hereof,  a
Non-Employee  Director  may  exercise  any  Option,  to  the  extent  such  Option  is
vested, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company; provided, however,
that in no event shall an Option be exercisable for a fractional share.  The date of
exercise  of  an  Option  shall  be  the  later  of  (A)  the  date  on  which  the  Company
receives  such  written  notice  and  (B)  the  date  on  which  the  Non-Employee
Director pays the applicable consideration pursuant to Section 5(e)(ii).

ii. METHOD  OF  EXERCISE.    The  consideration  to  be  paid  for  the  Shares  to  be
issued upon exercise of an Option may consist of (A) cash, (B) check, (C) other
Shares  that  have  a  Fair  Market  Value  on  the  date  of  surrender  equal  to  the
aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which the Option shall be exercised,
(D)  delivery  of  a  properly  executed  exercise  notice  together  with  irrevocable
instructions to a broker to sell Shares and promptly deliver to the Company the
amount of proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (E) any combination of
the  foregoing  methods  of  payment.    Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the

4

foregoing, any vested and exercisable Options may also be Net Exercised, to the
extent permitted by the Administrator.

iii. SHAREHOLDER  RIGHTS.    A  Non-Employee  Director  shall  have  no  rights  as  a
shareholder with respect to any Shares issuable upon exercise of an Option until
such  Shares  shall  have  been  issued  to  the  Non-Employee  Director  pursuant  to
Section 5(e), and, except as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made
to  an  Option  or  Share  issued  upon  the  exercise  thereof  for  dividends,
distributions or other rights in respect of any Share for which the record date is
prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder
of record thereof.

(f)

ISSUANCE  OF  SHARES.    Subject  to  the  foregoing  conditions,  as  soon  as  is
reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of exercise and, if applicable, payment
of the exercise price of the Option for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is
exercised,  the  Company  shall  deliver  to  the  Non-Employee  Director  (or  following  the  Non-
Employee Director’s death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the principal office
of  the  Company  or  at  such  other  location  as  may  be  acceptable  to  the  Company  and  the  Non-
Employee  Director  (or  such  Beneficiary),  the  appropriate  number  of  Shares  to  be  issued  in
connection  with  such  exercise.    Delivery  of  such  Shares  shall  be  evidenced  by  an  appropriate
entry  on  the  books  of  the  Company  or  a  duly  authorized  transfer  agent  of  the  Company,  or  in
such  other  manner  that  the  Administrator  shall  specify  from  time  to  time.    Shares  sold  in
connection  with  a  “cashless  exercise”  shall  be  delivered  to  the  broker  referred  to  therein  in
accordance with procedures established by the Company from time to time.

RESTRICTIONS  ON  TRANSFER.    An  Award  may  not  be  transferred,  pledged,  assigned,  or
6.
otherwise disposed of, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that,
with the approval of the Administrator, an Award may be transferred to a Non-Employee Director’s family
members or to one or more trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such
family members.  An Option shall be exercisable, during the Non-Employee Director’s lifetime, only by the
Non-Employee  Director  or  by  the  individual  or  entity  to  whom  the  Option  has  been  transferred  in
accordance  with  the  previous  sentence.    No  assignment  or  transfer  of  an  Award,  or  of  the  rights
represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, except by will or
the  laws  of  descent  and  distribution,  shall  vest  in  the  assignee  or  transferee  any  interest  or  right  in  the
Award, but immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Award the same shall terminate and be
of no force or effect.

7.

ADJUSTMENTS.

(a)

Upon  (or,  as  may  be  necessary  to  effect  the  adjustment,  immediately  prior  to)
any  reclassification,  recapitalization,  stock  split  (including  a  stock  split  in  the  form  of  a  stock
dividend)  or  reverse  stock  split;  any  merger,  combination,  consolidation  or  other  reorganization;
any  spin-off,  split-up,  split-off  or  extraordinary  dividend  distribution  in  respect  of  the  Common
Stock;  or  any  exchange  of  Common  Stock  or  other  securities  of  the  Company,  or  any  similar,
unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock, the Administrator
shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1) the number and type of Shares (or other securities)
that  thereafter  may  be  made  the  subject  of  Awards  (including  the  Share  Limit,  maximums  and
number of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2) the number, amount and type of Shares (or
other  securities  or  property)  subject  to  any  outstanding  Awards,  (3)  the  exercise  price  of  any
outstanding Options, and/or (4) the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or
settlement of any outstanding Awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not
increase)  the  level  of  incentives  intended  by  the  Plan  and  the  then-outstanding  Awards.    Any
good  faith  determination  by  the  Administrator  as  to  whether  an  adjustment  is  required  in  the

5

circumstances pursuant to this Section 7(a), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment,
shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.

(b)

It  is  intended  that,  unless  otherwise  determined  by  the  Administrator,  any
adjustments  contemplated  by  Section  7(a)  be  made  in  a  manner  that  satisfies  applicable  legal,
tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Code Section 409A) and
accounting  (so  as  to  not  trigger  any  charge  to  earnings  with  respect  to  such  adjustment)
requirements.

(c)

Any  adjustment  under  this  Section  7  need  not  be  the  same  for  all  persons  or

Awards.

8.
CHANGE OF CONTROL.  Upon the occurrence of any Change of Control, any then outstanding
Award automatically shall become vested or exercisable, as the case may be, with respect to a prorated
portion of the number of Shares subject to such Award, determined as follows:

(a)

CLIFF-VESTING  AWARDS.    If  the  Award  has  one  scheduled  Vesting  Date,  the
portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change
of  Control:    (i)  the  number  of  Shares  subject  to  such  Award,  multiplied  by  (ii)  a  fraction  (A)  the
numerator  of  which  is  the  number  of  days  elapsed  from  and  including  the  date  the  Award  was
granted to the date of the Change of Control, and (B) the denominator is the number of days from
and including the date of grant to and including the scheduled Vesting Date.

(b)

INSTALLMENT-VESTING  AWARDS.    If  the  Award  has  multiple  scheduled
Vesting Dates, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest
upon the Change of Control:  (i) the number of Shares subject to the portion of such Award that is
scheduled  to  vest  on  the  first  Vesting  Date  that  is  scheduled  to  occur  following  the  Change  of
Control,  multiplied  by  (ii)  a  fraction  (A)  the  numerator  of  which  is  the  number  of  days  elapsed
following and excluding the most recent Vesting Date prior to the Change of Control, and (B) the
denominator  is  the  number  of  days  from  and  excluding  such  most  recent  Vesting  Date  to  and
including the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control.

9.

DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY.

(a)

BENEFICIARY DESIGNATIONS.  Each Non-Employee Director may designate a
Beneficiary  to  exercise  an  Option  or  receive  settlement  of  an  Award  upon  the  Non-Employee
Director’s  death  by  executing  a  Beneficiary  Designation  Form  and  delivering  it  to  the
Administrator.

(b)

CHANGE  OF  BENEFICIARY  DESIGNATION.    A  Non-Employee  Director  may
change an earlier Beneficiary designation by executing a later Beneficiary Designation Form and
delivering it to the Administrator.  The execution of a Beneficiary Designation Form and its receipt
by the Administrator shall revoke and rescind any prior Beneficiary Designation Form.

10.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN.

(a)

TERMINATION.  Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the Plan shall terminate
on November 12, 2027.  Following such date, no further grants of Awards shall be made pursuant
to the Plan.

(b)

GENERAL  POWER  OF  BOARD.    Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the
contrary, the Board may at any time and from time to time terminate, modify, suspend or amend
the Plan in whole or in part (including amend the Plan at any time and from time to time, without

6

shareholder approval, to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of Restricted Stock
Units  and  Options  subject  to  Awards  granted  to  Non-Employee  Directors  on  the  date  of  each
Annual  Meeting  or  upon  becoming  a  Non-Employee  Director  and  the  methodology  for
determining the number of Shares to be subject to such Awards, each within the Share Limit and
the  individual  limit  set  forth  in  Section  3,  and  the  other  terms  and  conditions  applicable  to  such
Awards)  or,  subject  to  Sections  10(c)  and  10(d),  amend  the  terms  of  any  outstanding  Award;
provided,  however,  that  no  such  termination,  modification,  suspension  or  amendment  shall  be
effective without shareholder approval if such approval is required to comply with any applicable
law  or  stock  exchange  rule;  and  provided  further  that  the  Board  may  not,  without  shareholder
approval, increase the maximum number of Shares issuable under the Plan except as provided in
Section 7.  For avoidance of doubt, the Board may, without shareholder approval, provide on a
prospective  basis  for  grants  under  the  Plan  to  consist  of  Options  only,  Restricted  Stock  Units
only,  or  a  combination  of  Options  and  Restricted  Stock  Units  on  such  terms  and  conditions,
subject to the Share Limit and the other express limits of the Plan, as may be established by the
Board.

(c)

WHEN  NON-EMPLOYEE  DIRECTORS’  CONSENTS  REQUIRED.    The  Board
may  not  alter,  amend,  suspend  or  terminate  the  Plan,  or  amend  the  terms  of  any  outstanding
Award,  without  the  consent  of  any  Non-Employee  Director  to  the  extent  that  such  action  would
adversely  affect  his  or  her  rights  with  respect  to  Awards  that  have  previously  been  granted,
except  to  the  extent  such  action  is  necessary  to  comply  with  applicable  law  or  stock  exchange
listing rules or accounting rules.

(d)

NO  REPRICING.    In  no  case  (except  due  to  an  adjustment  contemplated  by
Section 7 or any repricing that may be approved by shareholders) shall any action be taken with
respect  to  the  Plan  or  any  Option  hereunder  that  would  constitute  a  repricing  (by  amendment,
substitution,  cancellation  and  regrant,  exchange  or  other  means,  including  any  action  that  is
treated  as  a  repricing  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles)  of  the  per  Share
exercise price of any Option.

11.

MISCELLANEOUS.

(a)

NO  RIGHT  TO  NOMINATION.    Nothing  in  the  Plan  shall  be  deemed  to  create
any  obligation  on  the  part  of  the  Board  to  nominate  any  of  its  members  for  reelection  by  the
Company’s  shareholders,  nor  confer  upon  any  Non-Employee  Director  the  right  to  remain  a
member of the Board for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation.

(b)

REGULATORY  REQUIREMENTS.    The  Administrator  may  require  each  Non-
Employee  Director  or  any  other  person  purchasing  or  acquiring  Shares  pursuant  to  the  Plan  to
agree with the Company in writing that such Non-Employee Director is acquiring the Shares for
investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof or provide such other assurances and
representations to the Company as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure
compliance  with  all  applicable  legal  and  accounting  requirements.    Shares  delivered  under  the
Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may
deem  advisable  under  the  rules,  regulations  and  other  requirements  of  the  Securities  and
Exchange Commission or any exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed, and any
applicable  federal  or  state  securities  law.    No  Shares  shall  be  issued  hereunder  unless  the
Company  shall  have  determined  that  such  issuance  is  in  compliance  with,  or  pursuant  to  an
exemption from, all applicable federal and state securities laws.

(c)
by the Company.

EXPENSES.    The  costs  and  expenses  of  administering  the  Plan  shall  be  borne

7

(d)

APPLICABLE LAW.  Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan and all actions
taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
California without giving effect to conflicts of law principles.

(e)

SEVERABILITY.  If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid

and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect.

(f)

SECTION HEADINGS; INTERPRETATION.  Captions and headings are given to

the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference.  Such
headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation
of the Plan or any provision thereof.

(g)

AUTHORITY OF THE COMPANY AND SHAREHOLDERS.  The existence of the
Plan shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Company or the shareholders
of the Company to make or authorize (i) any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other
change in the Company’s capital structure or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) any
merger,  amalgamation,  consolidation  or  change  in  the  ownership  of  the  Company  or  any
Subsidiary, (iii) any issue of bonds, debentures, capital, preferred or prior preference stock ahead
of or affecting the capital stock (or the rights thereof) of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iv) any
dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any Subsidiary, (v) any sale or transfer of all or any
part  of  the  assets  or  business  of  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary,  (vi)  the  payment  at  the
discretion of the Board of any type or form of compensation to Non-Employee Directors that may
be  made  at  law  and  without  contravention  of  any  requirement  of  the  principal  exchange  upon

more Awards that the Fair Market Value shall equal the last price for a Share on the Market on the last

the value as reasonably determined by the Administrator for purposes of the Award in the circumstances.
The Administrator also may adopt a different methodology for determining Fair Market Value with respect
to  one  or  more  Awards  if  a  different  methodology  is  necessary  or  advisable  to  secure  any  intended
favorable tax, legal or other treatment for the particular Awards (for example, and without limitation, the
Administrator may provide that Fair Market Value for purposes of one or more Awards shall be based on
an average of closing prices (or the average of high and low daily trading prices) for a specified period
preceding the relevant date).

 “NET EXERCISED” shall mean the exercise of an Option or any portion thereof by the delivery to
the person exercising such Option of the greatest number of whole Shares having a Fair Market Value on

Shares  subject  to  the  Option  (or  the  portion  of  such  Option  then  being  exercised)  and  the  aggregate
exercise price for all such Shares under the Option (or the portion thereof then being exercised), with any
fractional share that would result from such equation to be payable in cash.

stock or voting power is beneficially owned directly or indirectly by the Company.  An entity that attains
