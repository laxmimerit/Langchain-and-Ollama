There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.</p>\\n<h2>Foreign Exchange Rate Risk</h2>\\n<p>To  protect  gross  margins  from  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  the  Company  may  use  forwards,  options  or  other instruments,  and  may  designate  these  instruments  as  cash  flow  hedges.  The  Company  generally  hedges  portions  of  its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.</p>\\n<p>To  protect  the  Company\\'s  foreign  currency-denominated  term  debt  or  marketable  securities  from  fluctuations  in  foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments.

As of December\\xa028, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 18 years.</p>\\n<p>The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.</p>\\n<h2>Interest Rate Risk</h2>\\n<p>To protect the Company\\'s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments.

Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</h2>\\n<p>This Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (\\'Form 10-Q\\') contain forward-looking statements, within the  meaning  of  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995,  that  involve  risks  and  uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company\\'s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as \\'future,\\' \\'anticipates,\\' \\'believes,\\' \\'estimates,\\' \\'expects,\\' \\'intends,\\' \\'plans,\\' \\'predicts,\\' \\'will,\\' \\'would,\\' \\'could,\\' \\'can,\\' \\'may,\\' and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\\'s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading \\'Risk Factors.\\' The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.</p>\\n<p>Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  information  presented  herein  is  based  on  the  Company\\'s  fiscal  calendar,  and  references  to particular  years,  quarters,  months  or  periods  refer  to  the  Company\\'s  fiscal  years  ended  in  September  and  the  associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.</p>\\n<p>The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \\'SEC\\') and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.</p>\\n<h2>Available Information</h2>\\n<p>The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations  website,  investor.apple.com.

Further, the Company\\'s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.</p>\\n<h2>Business Seasonality and Product Introductions</h2>\\n<p>The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales  and  operating  expenses.  The  timing  of  product  introductions  can  also  impact  the  Company\\'s  net  sales  to  its  indirect distribution  channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.</p>\\n<p>During the first quarter of 2025, the Company announced the following product updates:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'· \\';\">MacBook Pro ®</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'· \\';\">Mac mini ®</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'· \\';\">iMac ®</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'· \\';\">iPad mini ®</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Macroeconomic Conditions</h2>\\n<p>Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.</p>\\n<h2>Segment Operating Performance</h2>\\n<p>The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December\\xa030, 2023 (dollars in millions):</p>\\n<table><tbody><tr><td></td><th colspan=\"3\">Three Months Ended</th></tr><tr><td></td><th>December 28, 2024</th><th>December 30, 2023</th><th>Change</th></tr><tr><th>Americas</th><td>$ 52,648</td><td>$ 50,430</td><td>4 %</td></tr><tr><th>Europe</th><td>33,861</td><td>30,397</td><td>11 %</td></tr><tr><th>Greater China</th><td>18,513</td><td>20,819</td><td>(11)%</td></tr><tr><th>Japan</th><td>8,987</td><td>7,767</td><td>16 %</td></tr><tr><th>Rest of Asia Pacific</th><td>10,291</td><td>10,162</td><td>1 %</td></tr><tr><th>Total net sales</th><td>$ 124,300</td><td>$ 119,575</td><td>4 %</td></tr></tbody></table>\\n<h2>Americas</h2>\\n<p>Americas net sales increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024 due primarily to higher net sales of Services and iPhone.

The  Company  will  adopt  ASU  2023-09  in  its  fourth  quarter  of  2026  using  a prospective transition method.</p>\\n<h2>Segment Reporting</h2>\\n<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\\'ASU 2023-07\\'), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to  the  Company\\'s chief  operating  decision  maker  (\\'CODM\\').  In  addition,  ASU  2023-07  will  require  the  Company  to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method.</p>\\n<h2>Critical Accounting Estimates</h2>\\n<p>The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and the Company\\'s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\\'s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \\'Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\' of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2024 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\\'s  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements.  There  have  been  no  material  changes  to  the  Company\\'s  critical accounting estimates since the 2024 Form 10-K.</p>\\n<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</h2>\\n<p>There have been no material changes to the Company\\'s market risk during the first three months of 2025. For a discussion of the Company\\'s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company\\'s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, \\'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\' of the 2024 Form 10-K.</p>\\n<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures</h2>\\n<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>\\n<p>Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\\'s management, the Company\\'s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\\'s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  under  the  Exchange  Act  were  effective  as  of  December\\xa0 28,  2024  to  provide  reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)\\xa0 recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and  forms  and (ii)\\xa0 accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company\\'s  management,  including  its  principal  executive  officer  and  principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>\\n<h2>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>\\n<p>There were no changes in the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2025, which were identified  in  connection  with  management\\'s  evaluation  required  by  paragraph  (d)  of  Rules  13a-15  and  15d-15  under  the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting.</p>\\n<h2>PART II  -  OTHER INFORMATION</h2>\\n<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings</h2>\\n<h2>Digital Markets Act Investigations</h2>\\n<p>On  March  25,  2024,  the  Commission  announced  that  it  had  opened  two  formal  noncompliance  investigations  against  the Company under the European Union (\\'EU\\') Digital Markets Act (the \\'DMA\\'). The Commission\\'s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4)  of  the  DMA,  which  relates  to  how  developers  may  communicate  and  promote  offers  to  end  users  for  apps  distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which  relates  to  default  settings,  uninstallation  of  apps,  and  a  web  browser  choice  screen  on  iOS.  On  June  24,  2024,  the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company\\'s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company\\'s  new  contractual  requirements  for  third-party  app  developers  and  app  marketplaces  may  violate  the  DMA.  If  the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company\\'s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission\\'s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.</p>\\n<h2>Department of Justice Lawsuit</h2>\\n<p>On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the \\'DOJ\\') and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  New  Jersey  against  the  Company  alleging  monopolization  or attempted monopolization in the markets for \\'performance smartphones\\' and \\'smartphones\\' in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.</p>\\n<h2>Epic Games</h2>\\n<p>Epic Games, Inc. (\\'Epic\\') filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \\'California District Court\\') against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\\'s unfair competition law based upon the Company\\'s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\\'s App Store  Review  Guidelines  violate  California\\'s  unfair  competition  law  and  issued  an  injunction  enjoining  the  Company  from prohibiting  developers  from  including  in  their  apps  external  links  that  direct  customers  to  purchasing  mechanisms  other  than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS ®  App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District  Court.  A  motion  by  Epic  disputing  the  Company\\'s  compliance  plan  and  seeking  to  enforce  the  injunction,  which  the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.</p>\\n<h2>Other Legal Proceedings</h2>\\n<p>The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the  aggregate  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company\\'s  financial  condition  or  operating  results.  The  outcome  of  litigation  is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\\'s expectations, the Company\\'s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.</p>\\n<h2>Item 1A. Risk Factors</h2>\\n<p>The Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors,  whether  currently  known  or  unknown,  including  those  described  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  the 2024  Form  10-K  under  the heading \\'Risk Factors.\\' When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company\\'s risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K.</p>\\n<h2>The  Company  is  subject  to  complex  and  changing  laws  and  regulations  worldwide,  which  exposes  the  Company  to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\\'s business.</h2>\\n<p>The Company\\'s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and  technology;  product  liability;  intellectual  property  ownership  and  infringement;  digital  platforms;  machine  learning  and artificial  intelligence;  internet,  telecommunications  and  mobile  communications;  media,  television,  film  and  digital  content; availability  of  third-party  software  applications  and  services;  labor  and  employment;  anticorruption;  import,  export  and  trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti-money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; national security; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.</p>\\n<p>Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company\\'s business by increasing the Company\\'s costs, limiting the  Company\\'s ability to  offer  a  product,  service  or  feature  to  customers,  imposing  changes  to  the  design  of  the  Company\\'s products  and  services,  impacting  customer  demand  for  the  Company\\'s  products  and  services,  and  requiring  changes  to  the Company\\'s  business  or  supply  chain.  New  and  changing  laws,  regulations,  executive  orders,  directives,  and  enforcement priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.</p>\\n<p>Risks  and  costs  related  to  new  and  changing  laws,  regulations,  executive  orders,  directives,  and  enforcement  priorities  may increase  as  the  Company\\'s  products  and  services  are  introduced  into  specialized  applications,  including  health  and  financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\\'s  employees,  contractors  or  agents  will  not  violate  such  laws  and  regulations  or  the  Company\\'s  policies  and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.</p>\\n<p>Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business may be announced with little or no  advance  notice  and  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to  effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\\'s products  could  be  banned,  delayed  or  prohibited  from  importation,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.</p>\\n<h2>The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.</h2>\\n<p>From  time  to  time,  the  Company  has  made  changes  to  its  App  Store,  including  actions  taken  in  response  to  litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.</p>\\n<p>The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for  iOS  and  iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company\\'s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (\\'APIs\\') for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Although the Company\\'s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA\\'s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.</p>\\n<p>The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result  in  legal  proceedings  and  claims  against  the  Company  that  could,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  have  a  materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject to  civil  antitrust  lawsuits  in  the  U.S.  alleging  monopolization  or  attempted  monopolization  in  the  markets  for  \\'performance smartphones\\'  and  \\'smartphones\\'  generally  in  violation  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws.  In  addition,  the  Company  is  the  subject  of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.</p>\\n<p>Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject  to  investigations  and  litigation  that,  if  resolved  against  those  other  companies,  could  materially  adversely  affect  the Company\\'s  commercial  relationships  with  those  business  partners  and  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company\\'s  business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC (\\'Google\\') and other companies to offer their search services on the Company\\'s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024, Google was found  to  have  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws.  In  connection  with  this  finding,  the  DOJ  has  proposed  remedies,  which  include changes to Google\\'s products, services and business models. The proposed changes vary in scope and severity and range from imposing significant restrictions on Google\\'s licensing agreements to prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for search distribution for up to 10 years. If implemented, such remedies could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s ability to earn revenue from such licensing arrangements.</p>\\n<p>There can be no assurance the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\\'s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal  proceedings  can  negatively  impact  the  reputation  of  the  Company\\'s  products  for  privacy  and  security  and  otherwise adversely  affect  the  experience  for  users  of  the  Company\\'s  products  and  services,  and  result  in  harm  to  the  Company\\'s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, lost sales, and lower profit margins.</p>\\n<h2>Item 2.

Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, excluding Options granted pursuant to any Non-423(b)  Offering,  no  Participant  shall  be  granted  an  Option  to purchase Shares under this Plan which permits the Participant\\'s rights to purchase Shares under all \\'employee stock purchase plans\\' (described in Section\\xa0423 of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to accrue at a rate which exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) of the Fair Market Value of such Shares (determined at the time such Options are granted) for each calendar year in which such Options are outstanding at any time.</li>\\n<li>(d) 5% Owner Limit.  Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary,  no  Participant  shall  be  granted  an  Option  to  purchase Shares under this Plan if such Participant (or any other person whose stock  would  be  attributed  to  such  Participant  pursuant  to  Section 424(d) of the Code), immediately after such Option is granted, would own or hold options to purchase Shares possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.</li>\\n<li>(e) Other Limitation.  The Administrator may determine, as to any Offering Period, that the offering will not be extended to \\'highly compensated employees\\' within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code.</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'(6) \\';\">Participation in the Plan.  An Eligible Employee may become a Participant for an Offering Period by completing the prescribed Enrollment  Agreement  and submitting  such  Enrollment  Agreement  to  the  Company  (or  the  Company\\'s designee),  in  the  format  and  pursuant  to  the  process  as  prescribed  by  the Administrator,  during  the  Enrollment  Period  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the Offering Period to which it relates.  Such Enrollment Agreement shall contain the payroll  deduction  authorization  described  in  Section  (8).    A  payroll  deduction authorization will be effective for the first Offering Period following the submission</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>of the Enrollment Agreement and all subsequent Offering Periods as provided by Section (7) until (i) it is terminated in accordance with Sections (9) or (14), (ii) it is modified by filing another Enrollment Agreement in accordance with this Section (6),  (iii)  an  election  is  made  to  decrease  payroll  deductions  in  accordance  with Section (8), (iv) the Participant\\'s Termination of Service, or (v) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'(7) \\';\">Automatic  Re-Enrollment.    Following  the  end  of  each  Offering  Period,  each Participant  shall  be  automatically  re-enrolled  in  the  next  Offering  Period  at  the applicable rate of payroll deductions in effect on the last Trading Day of the prior Offering  Period  or  otherwise  as  provided  under  Section  (8),  unless  (i)  the Participant has elected to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section (9), (ii)  the  Participant\\'s  Termination  of  Service,  or  (iii)  the  Participant  is  otherwise ineligible to participate in the next Offering Period. Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the  Administrator  may  require  current  Participants  to  complete  and submit a new Enrollment Agreement at any time it deems necessary or desirable to facilitate Plan administration or for any other reason.</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'(8) \\';\">Payroll  Deductions.    Each  Participant\\'s  Enrollment  Agreement  shall  contain  a payroll deduction authorization pursuant to which he or she shall elect to have a designated  whole  percentage  of  Eligible  Compensation  between  one  percent (1%) and ten percent (10%) deducted on each payday during the Offering Period and credited to the Participant\\'s Account for the purchase of Shares pursuant to the offering.  Payroll deductions shall commence on the Offering Date of the first Offering  Period  to  which  the  Enrollment  Agreement  relates  (or  as  soon  as administratively  practicable  thereafter)  and  shall  continue  through  subsequent Offering Periods pursuant to Section (7).  Participants shall not be permitted to make any separate cash payments into their Account for the purchase of Shares pursuant  to  an  offering.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  local  law  prohibits payroll  deductions,  a  Participant  may  elect  to  participate  in  an  Offering  Period through contributions to his or her Account in a format and pursuant to a process acceptable  to  the  Administrator.    In  such  event,  any  such  Participant  shall  be deemed  to  participate  in a separate  offering  under  the  Plan,  unless  the Administrator otherwise expressly provides.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>If  in  any payroll period a Participant has no pay or his or her pay is insufficient (after other authorized deductions) to permit deduction of the full amount of his or her  payroll  deduction  election,  then  (i)  the  payroll  deduction  election  for  such payroll period shall be reduced to the amount of pay remaining, if any, after all other authorized deductions, and (ii) the percentage or dollar amount of Eligible Compensation  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  reduced  by  the  amount  of  the reduction in the payroll deduction election for such payroll period.  Deductions of the full amount originally elected by the Participant will recommence as soon as his or her pay is sufficient to permit such payroll deductions; provided, however, no additional amounts will be deducted to satisfy the Outstanding Election.</p>\\n<p>A  Participant  may  elect  to  decrease,  but  not  increase,  the  rate  of  his  or  her payroll  deductions  during  an  Offering  Period  by  submitting  the  prescribed Enrollment Agreement to the Company (or the Company\\'s designee) at any time</p>\\n<p>prior to the first day of the last calendar month of such Offering Period.  Any such payroll deduction change will be effective as soon as administratively practicable thereafter and will remain in effect for successive Offering Periods as provided in Section (7) unless (i) the Participant submits a new Enrollment Agreement for a later  Offering  Period,  (ii)  the  Participant  elects  to  decrease  his  or  her  payroll deductions, (iii) the Participants elects to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with  Section  (9),  (iv)  the  Participant  is  withdrawn  from  the  Plan  in  accordance with Section (14), or (v) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.  A Participant may only increase his or her rate of payroll deductions to be effective for the next Offering Period by completing and filing with the Company a new Enrollment Agreement authorizing the payroll deductions.</p>\\n<p>Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Company  may  adjust  a  Participant\\'s  payroll deductions  at  any  time  during  an  Offering  Period  to  the  extent  necessary  to comply  with  Section  423(b)(8)  of  the  Code  and  the  limitations  of  Section  (5). Payroll  deductions  will  recommence  and  be  made  in  accordance  with  the Outstanding Election in place prior to such Company adjustment starting with the first Offering Period that begins in the next calendar year (or such other time as is determined by the Administrator) unless (i) the Participant withdraws in accordance  with  Section  (9),  (ii)  the  Participant  is  withdrawn  from  the  Plan  in accordance  with  Section  (14),  or  (iii)  the  Participant  is  otherwise  ineligible  to participate in the Plan.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'(9) \\';\">Withdrawal from Offering Period After Offering Date.  An Eligible Employee may withdraw from any Offering Period after the applicable Offering Date, in whole but not in part, at any time prior to the date specified by the Administrator or, if no such date is specified by the Administrator, the last Trading Day of such Offering Period,  by  submitting  the  prescribed  withdrawal  notice  to  the  Company  (or  the Company\\'s designee), in the format and pursuant to the process as prescribed by  the  Administrator.    If  a  Participant  withdraws  from  an  Offering  Period,  the Participant\\'s Option for such Offering Period will automatically be terminated, and the Company will refund in cash the Participant\\'s entire Account balance for such Offering Period as soon as practicable thereafter.  A Participant\\'s withdrawal from a  particular  Offering  Period  shall  be  irrevocable.    If  a  Participant  wishes  to participate in a subsequent Offering Period, he or she must re-enroll in the Plan by timely submitting a new Enrollment Agreement in accordance with Section (6).</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'(10) \\';\">Purchase  of  Stock.    On  the  last  Trading  Day  of  each  Offering  Period,  the Administrator shall cause the amount credited to each Participant\\'s Account to be applied  to  purchase  as  many  Shares  (or,  as  applicable,  fractions  of  a  Share) pursuant to the Participant\\'s Option as possible at the Purchase Price Per Share, subject  to  limitations  of  Sections  (3)  and  (5).    In  no  event  may  Shares  be purchased pursuant to an Option more than twenty-seven (27) months after the Offering Date of such Option.  The amount applied to purchase Shares pursuant to  the  Option  shall  be  deducted  from  the  Participant\\'s  Account.    Any  amounts remaining  credited  to  the  Participant\\'s  Account  on  the  last  Trading  Day  of  the Offering Period shall be retained in the Participant\\'s Account and rolled forward to the next Offering Period.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<ol>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'(11) \\';\">Interest  on  Payments.    No  interest  shall  be  paid  on  sums  withheld  from  a Participant\\'s  pay  for  the  purchase  of  Shares  under  this  Plan  unless  otherwise determined necessary by the Administrator.</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'(12) \\';\">Rights as Shareholder.  A Participant will not be a shareholder or have any rights as  a  shareholder  with  respect  to  Shares  subject  to  the  Participant\\'s  Options issued under the Plan until the Shares are purchased pursuant to the Options and such Shares are transferred into the Participant\\'s name on the Company\\'s books and records.</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'(13) \\';\">Options Not Transferable.  A Participant\\'s Options under this Plan may not be sold,  pledged,  assigned,  or  transferred  in  any  manner.    If  a  Participant  sells, pledges, assigns, or transfers his or her Options in violation of this Section (13), such Options shall immediately terminate, and the Participant shall immediately receive a refund of the amount then credited to the Participant\\'s Account.</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'(14) \\';\">Deemed Cancellations.</li>\\n<li>(a) Termination of Service.  In the event of a Participant\\'s Termination of Service,  (i)  any  outstanding  Option  held  by  the  Participant  shall immediately terminate; (ii) the Participant shall be withdrawn from the Plan; and (iii) the Participant shall receive a refund of the amount then credited to the Participant\\'s Account.</li>\\n<li>(b) Death of a Participant.  If a Participant dies, (i) any outstanding Option held  by  the  Participant  shall  immediately  terminate,  and  (ii)  the Participant shall be withdrawn from the Plan. As soon as administratively  practicable  after  the  Participant\\'s  death,  the  amount then  credited  to  the  Participant\\'s  Account  shall  be  remitted  to  the executor, administrator, or other legal representative of the Participant\\'s  estate  or,  if  the  Administrator  permits  a  beneficiary designation,  to  the  beneficiary  or  beneficiaries  designated  by  the Participant if such designation has been filed with the Company or the Company\\'s  designee  before such Participant\\'s death. If such executor, administrator, or other legal representative of the Participant\\'s estate has not been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company) or if the beneficiary or beneficiaries are no longer living at the time of the Participant\\'s death, the Company, in its discretion, may deliver the outstanding Account balance to the spouse or to any one or  more  dependents  or  relatives  of  the  Participant  or  to  such  other person as the Company may designate.</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'(15) \\';\">Application of Funds.  All funds received by the Company in payment for Shares purchased under this Plan and held by the Company at any time may be used for any valid corporate purpose.</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'(16) \\';\">No  Employment/Service Rights.

The purposes of the Plan are to retain the services of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company to serve as members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of the incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such individuals by granting such individuals Awards in respect of Shares.</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'2. \\';\">ADMINISTRATION .  The Administrator shall be responsible for administering the Plan.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have the full authority, in its sole discretion, to take any actions it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, including but not limited to:</li>\\n<li>(a) determining the Fair Market Value for purposes of any Award;</li>\\n<li>(b) approving any forms of Award Agreements to be used under the Plan;</li>\\n<li>(c) amending any outstanding Awards;</li>\\n<li>(d) construing and interpreting the Plan and any agreements defining the rights and obligations of the Company and Non-Employee Directors under the Plan;</li>\\n<li>(e) correcting any defect, supplying any omission or reconciling any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award Agreement;</li>\\n<li>(f) adopting such rules or guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan;</li>\\n<li>(g) authorizing  any  person  to  execute  on  behalf  of  the  Company  any  instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously authorized by the Administrator or the Plan;</li>\\n<li>(h) adjusting the number of shares subject to any Award, adjusting the price of any or  all  outstanding  Options  or  otherwise  changing  previously  imposed  terms  and  conditions,  in such circumstances as the Administrator may deem appropriate;</li>\\n<li>(i) determining whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant to Section 7 hereof; and</li>\\n<li>(j) making all other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Each interpretation,  determination,  or  other  action  made  or  taken  by  the  Administrator  pursuant  to  the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, and the Administrator\\'s determinations under the Plan need not  be  the  same  for  all  persons.    The  Administrator  shall  not  be  liable  for  any  action  or  determination made in good faith, and shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company\\'s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as such documents may be amended from time to time.</p>\\n<h2>3. SHARES AVAILABLE; LIMITS .</h2>\\n<p>(a) SHARE LIMIT .  Subject to the provisions of Section 7, the maximum number of Shares  that  may  be  issued  under  the  Plan  shall  not  exceed  11,200,000  Shares  (the  \\'Share Limit\\').  The stock issuable under the Plan shall be authorized and unissued Shares.</p>\\n<p>(b) SHARE COUNT .  Shares issued pursuant to Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall count against the Share Limit as two (2) Shares for every one (1) Share issued in connection with the Award.  Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Options shall count against the Share Limit as one (1) Share for every one (1) Share to which such exercise relates.  If Awards are settled in cash, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no cash settlement shall not be counted against the Share Limit.  Except as provided in the next sentence, if Awards are forfeited or are terminated for any reason before settlement or exercise, then the Shares underlying such Awards shall again become available for Awards under the Plan, provided that any one (1) Share subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award that is forfeited or terminated shall be credited as two (2) Shares when determining the number of Shares that shall again become available for Awards under  the  Plan.    Shares  that  are  exchanged  by  a  Non-Employee  Director  or  withheld  by  the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any Award under the Plan, as well as any Shares  exchanged  by  a  Non-Employee  Director  or  withheld  by  the  Company  or  one  of  its Subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any Award, shall not be available for subsequent Awards under the Plan.</p>\\n<p>(c) LIMIT ON COMPENSATION. In no event shall the compensation payable by the Company  to  a  Non-Employee  Director  for  services  performed  as  a  Non-Employee  Director, including the grant date value (determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of Awards, cash retainers, and other compensation, exceed $1,500,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year.</p>\\n<p>4. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS .    Unless  otherwise  determined  by  the  Administrator,  each  NonEmployee Director shall receive grants of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan subject to the following provisions of this Section 4 and the terms of any Award Agreement approved by the Administrator:</p>\\n<p>(a) ANNUAL GRANTS .  On the date of each Annual Meeting immediately following which a Non-Employee Director is serving on the Board, such Non-Employee Director shall be automatically granted an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing (i) $310,000 (or such other amount as determined by the Board and subject to the limitations of the Plan) by (ii)\\xa0the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an \\'Annual RSU Award\\').</p>\\n<p>(b) INITIAL  GRANTS .    Each  Non-Employee  Director  who  first  becomes  a  NonEmployee Director at any time other than on the date of an Annual Meeting shall be automatically granted, on the date he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director, an Award of a number of Restricted  Stock  Units  determined  by  multiplying  (i)  the  quotient  obtained  by  dividing  (A)\\xa0 the dollar  amount  applied  under  Section  4(a)  with  respect  to  Awards  granted  at  the  immediately preceding Annual Meeting by (B)\\xa0the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, by (ii) a fraction (A)\\xa0the numerator of which shall be the number of days remaining in the 365-day period following the most recent Annual Meeting, and (B)\\xa0the denominator of which shall be 365 (but in no event shall such fraction be greater than one (1)), such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an \\'Initial RSU Award\\'); provided, however, that a Non-Employee Director shall not be eligible to receive an Initial RSU Award if either (x) he or she was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to first becoming a Non-Employee Director, or (y) he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time on or after the February 1 following the last preceding Annual Meeting.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>(c) VESTING;  TERMINATION  OF  SERVICE .    Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  an Award Agreement at the time of grant, each Annual RSU Award shall fully vest on the February 1 that occurs in the fiscal year of the Company following the fiscal year in which the Award was granted.  Each Initial RSU Award shall fully vest on the Vesting Date established for the Annual RSU Awards granted in connection with the last Annual Meeting to occur prior to the grant date of such Initial RSU Award.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board for  any  reason  other  than  the  Non-Employee  Director\\'s  death,  the  Non-Employee  Director\\'s Restricted Stock Units shall terminate to the extent such Restricted Stock Units have not become vested prior to the first date the Non-Employee Director is no longer a member of the Board, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to, or in respect of, such terminated Restricted Stock Units.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board due to his or her death, the Non-Employee Director\\'s unvested Restricted Stock Units shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director\\'s death.</li>\\n<li>(d) SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS . On or as soon as administratively practical following the applicable Vesting Date (and in all events not later than two  and  one-half  months  after  the  applicable  Vesting  Date),  the  Company  shall  deliver  to  the Non-Employee Director a number of Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of  the  Company  or  a  duly  authorized  transfer  agent  of  the  Company)  equal  to  the  number  of Restricted  Stock  Units  that  vested  on  the  applicable  Vesting  Date.    Upon  settlement  of  any Restricted  Stock  Units  in  accordance  with  the  foregoing  provision  of  this  Section  4(d)  and settlement of any Dividend Equivalent Right in accordance with Section 4(f), the Non-Employee Director shall have no further rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units that are so paid.</li>\\n<li>(e) SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS .    A  Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly set forth in Section 4(f) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such Restricted Stock Units until such Shares have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 4(d).  Except for any Dividend  Equivalent  Rights  awarded  pursuant  to  Section  4(f)  or  as  provided  in  Section  7,  no adjustment shall be made in respect of any Restricted Stock Units for dividends or distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record of Shares related thereto.</li>\\n<li>(f) DIVIDEND  EQUIVALENT  RIGHTS  DISTRIBUTIONS .    As  of  any  date  that  the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Common Stock, the Company shall credit the Non-Employee Directors with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per Share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Common Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Restricted Stock Units (including as such total number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7) subject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior  to  the  record  date  for  that  dividend  (a  \\'Dividend Equivalent Right\\').  Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(f) shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash.  No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 4(f) with respect to any Restricted Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 4(d) or terminated pursuant to Section 4(c).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>5. OPTIONS.</h2>\\n<p>(a) NO ADDITIONAL GRANTS .  No Options shall be granted under the Plan unless and until the Board determines that the grant of Options is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.</p>\\n<p>(b) EXERCISE PRICE .  The per share exercise price of each Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date of grant of the Option determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.</p>\\n<p>(c) VESTING .  Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, Options shall be fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>(d) TERM OF OPTIONS .</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'i. \\';\">TEN-YEAR TERM .  Each Option shall expire ten (10) years from its date of grant, subject to earlier termination as provided herein.</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'ii. \\';\">TERMINATION  OF  SERVICE .    Upon  cessation  of  a  Non-Employee  Director\\'s service as a member of the Board for any reason other than death, any of the Non-Employee Director\\'s Options (or any portion thereof) that is not then vested shall terminate, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to,  or  in  respect  of,  such  terminated  Options.    If  the  Non-Employee  Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board due to his or her death, the NonEmployee Director\\'s Options shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director\\'s death.</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'iii. \\';\">EXERCISE  FOLLOWING  TERMINATIONS  OF  SERVICE .    If  a  Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason other than death, any Options granted to such Non-Employee Director that are exercisable at the time of the Non-Employee Director\\'s termination may be exercised by such NonEmployee Director at any time within ninety (90) days after the date of such NonEmployee  Director\\'s  termination  of  service,  subject  to  the  earlier  expiration  of such Options as provided for in Section 5(d)(i) above.  At the end of such ninetyday  period,  any  unexercised  portion  of  the  Option  shall  expire.    If  a  NonEmployee Director ceases to be a member of the Board by reason of his or her death, all of the Options granted to the Non-Employee Director may be exercised by his or her Beneficiary at any time within three (3) years after the date of the Non-Employee Director\\'s death, subject to the earlier expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 5(d)(i) above.  At the end of such three-year period, any unexercised portion of the Option shall expire.</li>\\n<li>(e) TIME AND MANNER OF EXERCISE OF OPTIONS .</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'i. \\';\">NOTICE  OF  EXERCISE .    Subject  to  the  other  terms  and  conditions  hereof,  a Non-Employee Director may exercise any Option, to the extent such Option is vested, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company; provided, however, that in no event shall an Option be exercisable for a fractional share.  The date of exercise of an Option shall be the later of (A)\\xa0the date on which the Company receives  such  written  notice  and  (B)\\xa0 the  date  on  which  the  Non-Employee Director pays the applicable consideration pursuant to Section 5(e)(ii).</li>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'ii. \\';\">METHOD OF EXERCISE .    The  consideration  to  be  paid  for  the  Shares  to  be issued upon exercise of an Option may consist of (A)\\xa0cash, (B)\\xa0check, (C)\\xa0other Shares  that  have  a  Fair  Market  Value  on  the  date  of  surrender  equal  to  the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which the Option shall be exercised, (D)\\xa0 delivery  of  a  properly  executed  exercise  notice  together  with  irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares and promptly deliver to the Company the amount of proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (E)\\xa0any combination of the  foregoing  methods  of  payment.    Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>foregoing, any vested and exercisable Options may also be Net Exercised, to the extent permitted by the Administrator.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: \\'iii. \\';\">SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS .    A  Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares issuable upon exercise of an Option until such Shares shall have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 5(e), and, except as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made to an Option or Share issued upon  the exercise thereof for dividends, distributions or other rights in respect of any Share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record thereof.</li>\\n<li>(f) ISSUANCE  OF  SHARES .    Subject  to  the  foregoing  conditions,  as  soon  as  is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of exercise and, if applicable, payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised,  the  Company  shall  deliver  to  the  Non-Employee  Director  (or  following  the  NonEmployee Director\\'s death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be acceptable to the Company and the NonEmployee  Director  (or  such  Beneficiary),  the  appropriate  number  of  Shares  to  be  issued  in connection with such exercise.  Delivery of such Shares shall be evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, or in such  other  manner  that  the  Administrator  shall  specify  from  time  to  time.    Shares  sold  in connection  with  a  \\'cashless  exercise\\'  shall  be  delivered  to  the  broker  referred  to  therein  in accordance with procedures established by the Company from time to time.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>6. RESTRICTIONS  ON  TRANSFER .    An  Award  may  not  be  transferred,  pledged,  assigned,  or otherwise disposed of, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that, with the approval of the Administrator, an Award may be transferred to a Non-Employee Director\\'s family members or to one or more trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such family members.  An Option shall be exercisable, during the Non-Employee Director\\'s lifetime, only by the Non-Employee  Director  or  by  the  individual  or  entity  to  whom  the  Option  has  been  transferred  in accordance  with  the  previous  sentence.    No  assignment  or  transfer  of  an  Award,  or  of  the  rights represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Award, but immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Award the same shall terminate and be of no force or effect.</p>\\n<h2>7. ADJUSTMENTS .</h2>\\n<p>(a) Upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any  reclassification,  recapitalization,  stock  split  (including  a  stock  split  in  the  form  of  a  stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, combination, consolidation or other reorganization; any  spin-off,  split-up,  split-off  or  extraordinary  dividend  distribution  in  respect  of  the  Common Stock;  or  any  exchange  of  Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock, the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1)\\xa0the number and type of Shares (or other securities) that  thereafter  may  be  made the subject of Awards (including the Share Limit, maximums and number of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2)\\xa0the number, amount and type of Shares (or other  securities  or  property)  subject  to  any  outstanding  Awards,  (3)\\xa0 the  exercise  price  of  any outstanding Options, and/or (4)\\xa0the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or settlement of any outstanding Awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase)  the  level  of  incentives  intended  by  the  Plan  and  the  then-outstanding  Awards.    Any good  faith  determination  by  the  Administrator  as  to  whether  an  adjustment  is  required  in  the</p>\\n<p>circumstances pursuant to this Section 7(a), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>(b) It  is  intended  that,  unless  otherwise  determined  by  the  Administrator,  any adjustments contemplated by Section 7(a) be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Code Section\\xa0409A) and accounting  (so  as  to  not trigger  any  charge  to  earnings  with  respect  to  such  adjustment) requirements.</li>\\n<li>(c) Any adjustment  under  this  Section  7  need  not  be  the  same  for  all  persons  or Awards.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>8. CHANGE OF CONTROL .  Upon the occurrence of any Change of Control, any then outstanding Award automatically shall become vested or exercisable, as the case may be, with respect to a prorated portion of the number of Shares subject to such Award, determined as follows:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>(a) CLIFF-VESTING AWARDS. If  the  Award has one scheduled Vesting Date, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control:  (i)\\xa0the number of Shares subject to such Award, multiplied by (ii)\\xa0a fraction (A)\\xa0the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from and including the date the Award was granted to the date of the Change of Control, and (B)\\xa0the denominator is the number of days from and including the date of grant to and including the scheduled Vesting Date.</li>\\n<li>(b) INSTALLMENT-VESTING  AWARDS. If  the  Award  has  multiple  scheduled Vesting Dates, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control:  (i)\\xa0the number of Shares subject to the portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest on the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control,  multiplied  by  (ii)\\xa0 a  fraction  (A)\\xa0 the  numerator  of  which  is  the  number  of  days  elapsed following and excluding the most recent Vesting Date prior to the Change of Control, and (B)\\xa0the denominator is the number of days from and excluding such most recent Vesting Date to and including the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>9. DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY.</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>(a) BENEFICIARY DESIGNATIONS .  Each Non-Employee Director may designate a Beneficiary  to  exercise  an  Option  or  receive  settlement  of  an  Award  upon  the  Non-Employee Director\\'s death by executing a Beneficiary Designation Form  and  delivering it to the Administrator.</li>\\n<li>(b) CHANGE  OF  BENEFICIARY  DESIGNATION .    A  Non-Employee  Director  may change an earlier Beneficiary designation by executing a later Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to the Administrator.  The execution of a Beneficiary Designation Form and its receipt by the Administrator shall revoke and rescind any prior Beneficiary Designation Form.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>10. TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN .</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>(a) TERMINATION .  Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the Plan shall terminate on November 12, 2027.

For avoidance of doubt, the Board may, without shareholder approval, provide on a prospective  basis  for  grants  under  the  Plan  to  consist  of  Options  only,  Restricted  Stock  Units only,  or  a  combination  of  Options  and  Restricted  Stock  Units  on  such  terms  and  conditions, subject to the Share Limit and the other express limits of the Plan, as may be established by the Board.</p>\\n<p>(c) WHEN  NON-EMPLOYEE  DIRECTORS\\'  CONSENTS  REQUIRED .    The  Board may not alter,  amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, or amend the terms of any outstanding Award, without the consent of any Non-Employee Director to the extent that such action would adversely  affect  his  or  her  rights  with  respect  to  Awards  that  have  previously  been  granted, except to the extent such action is necessary to comply with applicable law or stock exchange listing rules or accounting rules.</p>\\n<p>(d) NO  REPRICING .    In  no  case  (except  due  to  an  adjustment  contemplated  by Section 7 or any repricing that may be approved by shareholders) shall any action be taken with respect to the Plan or any Option hereunder that would constitute a repricing (by amendment, substitution,  cancellation  and  regrant,  exchange  or  other  means,  including  any  action  that  is treated  as  a  repricing  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles)  of  the  per  Share exercise price of any Option.</p>\\n<h2>11. MISCELLANEOUS .</h2>\\n<p>(a) NO RIGHT TO NOMINATION .    Nothing  in  the  Plan  shall  be  deemed  to  create any  obligation  on  the  part  of  the  Board  to  nominate  any  of  its  members  for  reelection  by  the Company\\'s  shareholders,  nor  confer  upon  any  Non-Employee  Director  the  right  to  remain  a member of the Board for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation.</p>\\n<p>(b) REGULATORY  REQUIREMENTS .    The  Administrator  may  require  each  NonEmployee Director or any other person purchasing or acquiring Shares pursuant to the Plan to agree with the Company in writing that such Non-Employee Director is acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof or provide such other assurances and representations to the Company as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements.  Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem  advisable  under  the  rules,  regulations  and  other  requirements  of  the  Securities  and Exchange Commission or any exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed, and any applicable  federal  or  state  securities  law.    No  Shares  shall  be  issued  hereunder  unless  the Company  shall  have  determined  that  such  issuance  is  in  compliance  with,  or  pursuant  to  an exemption from, all applicable federal and state securities laws.</p>\\n<p>(c) EXPENSES .    The costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company.</p>\\n<p>(d) APPLICABLE LAW .  Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflicts of law principles.</p>\\n<p>(e) SEVERABILITY. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue in effect.</p>\\n<p>(f) SECTION HEADINGS; INTERPRETATION .  Captions and headings are given to the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference.  Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.</p>\\n<p>(g) AUTHORITY OF THE COMPANY AND SHAREHOLDERS .  The existence of the Plan shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Company or the shareholders of the Company to make or authorize (i) any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company\\'s capital structure or business of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) any merger,  amalgamation,  consolidation  or  change  in  the  ownership  of  the  Company  or  any Subsidiary, (iii) any issue of bonds, debentures, capital, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the capital stock (or the rights thereof) of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iv) any dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any Subsidiary, (v) any sale or transfer of all or any part  of  the  assets  or  business  of  the  Company  or  any  Subsidiary,  (vi)  the  payment  at  the discretion of the Board of any type or form of compensation to Non-Employee Directors that may be  made  at  law  and  without  contravention  of  any  requirement  of  the  principal  exchange  upon which the Shares are traded, or (vii) any other corporate act or proceeding by the Company or any  Subsidiary,  whether  of  a  similar  character  or  otherwise.    No  Non-Employee  Director, beneficiary or other person shall have any claim under any Award or Award Agreement against any member of the Board or the Company, or any employees, officers or agents of the Company or any Subsidiary, as a result of any such action.</p>\\n<p>12.
