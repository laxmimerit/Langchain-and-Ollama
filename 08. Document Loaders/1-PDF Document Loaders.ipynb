This study investigated the actual consumption of fitness supple-\\nments utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Health Belief Model (HBM), and the Theory\\nof Effort Minimization in Physical Activity (TEMPA) frameworks. The TPB provided insights into\\nhow attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence individuals’ intentions\\nto consume fitness supplements. Additionally, the HBM sheds light on perceived effectiveness,\\nbenefits, barriers, and health motivation related to supplement consumption. Integrating the TEMPA\\nframework further investigated the role of effort minimization in physical activity contexts. Through\\nan online questionnaire, data were collected from a sample of 250 fitness supplement-consuming\\nrespondents. SEM analysis revealed significant associations between behavioral intentions and\\nattitudes, perceived behavioral control, health motivation, and controlled precursors. However, it\\nwas seen that subjective norms, perceived effectiveness, perceived benefits, and automatic precursors\\nwere deemed insignificant. The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the factors\\nshaping actual consumption behaviors, offering valuable implications for marketers, health profes-\\nsionals, and policymakers seeking to promote informed and responsible supplement use among\\nhealth and fitness enthusiasts.\\nKeywords: fitness supplements; health belief model; theory of effort of minimization; theory of\\nplanned behavior; structural equation modelling\\n1. Introduction\\nSupplementary drinks or fitness supplements are commonly used to enhance an\\nindividual’s performance in various sports and health settings, catering to both competitive\\nand non-competitive athletes [1]. One widely known supplement for athletes and fitness\\nenthusiasts is protein supplements like protein shakes. Others may be whey protein,\\ncaffeine, and creatine, to name a few. These supplements play a crucial role in helping\\nindividuals increase muscle mass, recover faster, and enhance their overall performance [2].\\nWhey protein stands out as a top-quality protein source, containing more essential amino\\nacids than traditional protein sources. Its numerous benefits have made it a popular choice\\nfor snacks and drinks among consumers [3]. Another widely embraced supplement is\\ncaffeine, which is found in many sports and food supplements. Caffeine reduces perceived\\neffort, minimizes fatigue and pain, and proves to be effective for endurance and high-\\nintensity activities, which is the choice of consumers [4].\\nCreatine monohydrate is another well-known supplement used to gain muscle mass\\nand support performance and recovery. It is known not to increase fat mass and remains\\neffective even when taken in recommended doses [5]. Despite its popularity in the fitness\\nFoods 2024, 13, 1424. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods13091424\\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods')"

      "To gain muscle mass (hypertrophy), a combination of resistance training, proper nutrition, recovery, and lifestyle factors is essential. Here's a structured approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Resistance Training (Exercise)**\n",
      "- **Focus on Compound Movements**: Prioritize exercises that work multiple muscle groups, such as:\n",
      "  - **Squats** (quads, glutes, hamstrings)\n",
      "  - **Deadlifts** (back, glutes, hamstrings)\n",
      "  - **Bench Press** (chest, triceps, shoulders)\n",
      "  - **Pull-Ups/Rows** (back, biceps)\n",
      "  - **Overhead Press** (shoulders, triceps)\n",
      "- **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase weight, reps, or intensity over time to continually challenge muscles.\n",
      "- **Training Frequency**: Train each major muscle group 2–3 times per week, with at least 48 hours of recovery between sessions for the same muscle group.\n",
      "- **Rep Range**: Aim for 6–12 reps per set for hypertrophy (focus on strength and volume).\n",
      "- **Warm-Up and Form**: Always warm up to prevent injury and ensure proper form to target the right muscles effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Nutrition**\n",
      "- **Protein Intake**: Consume **1.2–2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight** daily. Good sources include:\n",
      "  - Lean meats, eggs, dairy, legumes, tofu, and whey protein supplements.\n",
      "- **Caloric Surplus**: Eat more calories than you burn to provide energy for growth. Aim for a surplus of **250–500 calories/day**.\n",
      "- **Carbohydrates**: Fuel workouts with complex carbs (oats, rice, fruits, vegetables) and simple carbs post-workout for quick energy.\n",
      "- **Fats**: Include healthy fats (avocados, nuts, olive oil) for hormone production and overall health.\n",
      "- **Meal Timing**: Eat a **protein-rich meal or snack within 30–60 minutes post-workout** to support muscle recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Recovery and Rest**\n",
      "- **Sleep**: Aim for **7–9 hours of sleep per night** to allow muscles to repair and grow.\n",
      "- **Rest Days**: Take 1–2 rest days weekly to prevent overtraining and promote recovery.\n",
      "- **Active Recovery**: Light activities like walking or stretching on rest days can aid circulation and reduce soreness.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **4. Hydration and Lifestyle**\n",
      "- **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water (at least 3–4 liters/day) to support muscle function and recovery.\n",
      "- **Avoid Harmful Habits**: Limit alcohol and tobacco, as they can impair muscle growth and recovery.\n",
      "- **Stress Management**: Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which can hinder muscle growth. Practice mindfulness, meditation, or yoga.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **5. Supplements (Optional)**\n",
      "- **Whey Protein**: Helps meet protein needs, especially post-workout.\n",
      "- **Creatine**: Enhances strength and muscle gains (5–10 grams/day).\n",
      "- **BCAAs (Branched-Chain Amino Acids)**: May reduce muscle soreness and support recovery.\n",
      "- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Reduce inflammation and support joint health.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **6. Consistency and Tracking**\n",
      "- **Progress Tracking**: Measure body weight, circumference, or take progress photos to stay motivated.\n",
      "- **Adjustments**: Periodically adjust your workout routine or diet to avoid plateaus.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Example Daily Plan**\n",
      "- **Morning**: \n",
      "  - Breakfast: Oatmeal with protein powder, berries, and almond butter.\n",
      "  - Workout: Full-body strength training (squats, bench press, rows).\n",
      "- **Afternoon**: \n",
      "  - Snack: Greek yogurt with nuts and fruit.\n",
      "  - Light activity (walk, stretch).\n",
      "- **Evening**: \n",
      "  - Dinner: Grilled chicken, brown rice, and steamed veggies.\n",
      "  - Post-workout shake: Whey protein + banana.\n",

      "To reduce weight effectively and safely, consider the following evidence-based strategies, while being cautious about the risks associated with dietary supplements:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **1. Focus on a Balanced Diet**\n",
      "- **Caloric Deficit**: Create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.\n",
      "- **Limit Processed Foods**: Reduce intake of sugary drinks, refined carbohydrates (e.g., white bread, pastries), and highly processed snacks.\n",
      "- **Portion Control**: Use smaller plates, avoid overeating, and eat slowly to enhance satiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Incorporate Regular Physical Activity**\n",
      "- **Aerobic Exercise**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking, cycling) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (e.g., running) per week.\n",
      "- **Strength Training**: Include resistance exercises (e.g., weightlifting, bodyweight workouts) 2–3 times weekly to build muscle and boost metabolism.\n",
      "- **Daily Movement**: Add activity to daily routines (e.g., taking stairs, walking short distances) to increase overall calorie expenditure.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Stay Hydrated**\n",
      "- Drink water throughout the day to control hunger, support metabolic processes, and reduce calorie intake from sugary beverages.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **4. Prioritize Sleep and Stress Management**\n",
      "- **Sleep**: Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night. Poor sleep disrupts hormones regulating hunger and metabolism.\n",
      "- **Stress Reduction**: Chronic stress can lead to overeating and weight gain. Practice mindfulness, meditation, or relaxation techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **5. Be Cautious with Dietary Supplements**\n",
      "- **Avoid Unregulated Products**: Many weight-loss supplements (e.g., Ephedra, DMAA, green tea extract) have been linked to serious side effects like heart palpitations, liver damage, or strokes. The FDA has banned several due to safety concerns.\n",
      "- **Consult a Healthcare Provider**: If considering supplements, ensure they are FDA-approved and discuss potential interactions with medications.\n",
      "- **Focus on Natural Methods**: Supplements should complement, not replace, lifestyle changes. Prioritize sustainable habits over quick fixes.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **6. Monitor Progress and Adjust**\n",
      "- Track progress through regular weigh-ins and measurements (e.g., waist circumference). Adjust diet and exercise plans as needed, but avoid extreme diets or rapid weight loss, which can be harmful.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
      "- **Lifestyle Changes First**: A healthy diet and exercise are foundational to long-term weight management.\n",
      "- **Supplements as a Supplement**: Use supplements only under medical supervision and as part of a holistic plan.\n",
      "- **Avoid Risks**: Be wary of supplements with unproven efficacy or potential for serious side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any weight-loss program, especially if you have underlying health conditions.\n"

      "\n",
      "### 1. **Create a Calorie Deficit**\n",
      "   - **Track Intake:** Use apps or journals to monitor daily calorie consumption. Aim for a deficit of 500–750 calories/day for gradual weight loss (0.5–1 kg/week).\n",
      "   - **Prioritize Nutrient-Dense Foods:** Focus on:\n",
      "     - **Proteins:** Lean meats, fish, eggs, legumes, tofu.\n",
      "     - **Fruits/Vegetables:** High in fiber and water, which promote satiety.\n",
      "     - **Whole Grains:** Brown rice, quinoa, oats.\n",
      "     - **Healthy Fats:** Avocados, nuts, olive oil.\n",
      "   - **Limit Processed Foods:** Reduce sugary snacks, refined carbs (white bread, pastries), and high-fat fried foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Incorporate Physical Activity**\n",
      "   - **Cardiovascular Exercise:** Aim for 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity activities (e.g., brisk walking, cycling) or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise (e.g., running, swimming).\n",
      "   - **Strength Training:** 2–3 times/week to build muscle, which boosts metabolism.\n",
      "   - **Daily Movement:** Take stairs, walk during breaks, or do short workouts to increase calorie burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Behavioral and Lifestyle Adjustments**\n",
      "   - **Mindful Eating:** Eat slowly, avoid distractions (e.g., TV), and savor meals to reduce overeating.\n",
      "   - **Hydration:** Drink water before meals to reduce hunger and boost metabolism.\n",
      "   - **Sleep & Stress Management:** Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep nightly. Chronic stress can increase cortisol, leading to weight gain.\n",
      "   - **Avoid Emotional Eating:** Replace stress or boredom with activities like walking, reading, or journaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Avoid Quick Fixes**\n",
      "   - **No Extreme Diets:** Restrictive diets (e.g., crash diets) can slow metabolism and lead to regain.\n",
      "   - **Focus on Sustainability:** Choose foods you enjoy in moderation. For example, allow occasional treats but in smaller portions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Monitor Progress**\n",
      "   - **Track Changes:** Use a journal or app to log meals, workouts, and weight. Celebrate small wins (e.g., 100 steps more daily).\n",
      "   - **Adjust as Needed:** If progress stalls, reassess calorie intake, exercise routine, or stress levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Seek Support**\n",
      "   - **Professional Guidance:** Consult a dietitian or doctor for personalized plans, especially if you have health conditions.\n",
      "   - **Accountability:** Join groups or apps with others pursuing weight loss for motivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Daily Plan:\n",
      "- **Breakfast:** Greek yogurt with berries and almonds.\n",
      "- **Snack:** Apple with peanut butter.\n",
      "- **Lunch:** Grilled chicken salad with olive oil and quinoa.\n",
      "- **Snack:** Carrot sticks with hummus.\n",
      "- **Dinner:** Baked salmon with steamed broccoli and brown rice.\n",
      "- **Exercise:** 30-minute walk after dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** Individual results vary. Consistency and patience are key. Avoid fad diets or supplements without medical advice.\n"

      "5. **Herbal Supplements:**  \n",
      "   - **Black Cohosh:** Associated with liver failure and bradycardia.  \n",
      "   - **Kava Kava:** Linked to liver toxicity via oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.  \n",
      "   - **Ginkgo Biloba and Garlic:** Increased bleeding risk, especially with anticoagulants.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Notable Cases and Bans:**  \n",
      "- **OxyELITE Pro:** Caused over 100 cases of liver injury, leading to FDA bans on DMAA and aegeline.  \n",
      "- **Ephedra:** Banned in 2004 due to cardiovascular risks.  \n",
      "- **DMAA:** Prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) as a performance-enhancing drug.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Regulatory Challenges:**  \n",
      "- Supplements often lack rigorous pre-market safety testing, leading to potential contamination or undisclosed ingredients.  \n",
      "- Adverse effects are underreported, and interactions with medications (e.g., anticoagulants) pose risks.  \n",
      "- Consumer education is critical, as many users do not disclose supplement use to healthcare providers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**  \n",

      "### FDA Regulation under DSHEA\n",
      "- **Pre-Market Approval**: Unlike drugs, supplements do not require FDA approval before sale.\n",
      "- **Post-Market Monitoring**: FDA can only act on adverse reports after products are on the market.\n",
      "- **Adulteration**: Supplements may contain unlisted ingredients or banned substances (e.g., DMAA, ephedra).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Regulatory Actions\n",
      "- **Ban on Ephedra and DMAA**: FDA banned these substances due to severe health risks.\n",
      "- **OxyELITE Pro Recall**: Products containing DMAA and aegeline were recalled after reports of liver failure and hepatitis.\n",
      "- **Labeling Requirements**: Supplements must list ingredients and disclaimers (e.g., \"This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease\").\n",
      "\n",
      "### Challenges\n",
      "- **Limited Clinical Trials**: Most supplements lack rigorous testing for safety and efficacy.\n",
      "- **Unlisted Ingredients**: Contamination with undeclared substances poses risks to consumers.\n",

      "## 7. Conclusion\n",
      "Dietary supplements and nutraceuticals offer potential health benefits but carry significant risks, particularly when misused or contaminated. Regulatory frameworks like DSHEA have enabled widespread availability but also created challenges in ensuring safety. Consumers should consult healthcare providers before use, and stricter regulations are needed to address adulteration, drug interactions, and long-term health impacts. Ongoing research and improved oversight are critical to balancing the benefits and risks of these products.\n",
