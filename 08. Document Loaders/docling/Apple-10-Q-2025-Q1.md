In  the  opinion  of  the  Company's  management,  the  condensed  consolidated  financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ('GAAP') requires the use of management estimates. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 (the '2024 Form 10-K').

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company's fiscal years 2025 and 2024 span 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

- (1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
- (2) As  of  December  28,  2024  and  September  28,  2024,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  included  $126  million  and  $2.6  billion, respectively, held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted cash and cash equivalents are designated to settle the Company's obligation related to the 2016 European Commission (the 'Commission') decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company (the 'State Aid Decision'), which was confirmed during the fourth quarter of 2024 by the European Court of Justice in a reversal of the 2020 judgment of the European General Court.
- (3) As of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, current marketable securities included $3.3 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted marketable securities are designated to settle the Company's obligation related to the State Aid Decision.

As  of  December  28,  2024,  85%  of  the  Company's  non-current  marketable  debt  securities  other  than  mortgage-  and  assetbacked securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 11% between 5 and 10 years, and 4% greater than 10 years. As of December 28, 2024, 13% of the Company's non-current mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 10% between 5 and 10 years, and 77% greater than 10 years.

## Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To  protect  gross  margins  from  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  the  Company  may  use  forwards,  options  or  other instruments,  and  may  designate  these  instruments  as  cash  flow  hedges.  The  Company  generally  hedges  portions  of  its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To  protect  the  Company's  foreign  currency-denominated  term  debt  or  marketable  securities  from  fluctuations  in  foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of December 28, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 18 years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

## Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

The notional amounts of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments as of December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024 were as follows (in millions):

## Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ('Form 10-Q') contain forward-looking statements, within the  meaning  of  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995,  that  involve  risks  and  uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company's business and results of operations are forward-looking statements . Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as 'future,' 'anticipates,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'expects,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'predicts,' 'will,' 'would,' 'could,' 'can,' 'may,' and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading 'Risk Factors.' The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  information  presented  herein  is  based  on  the  Company's  fiscal  calendar,  and  references  to particular  years,  quarters,  months  or  periods  refer  to  the  Company's  fiscal  years  ended  in  September  and  the  associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2024 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

## Available Information

The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations  website,  investor.apple.com.  This  includes  press  releases  and  other  information  about  financial  performance, information  on  environmental,  social  and  governance  matters,  and  details  related  to  the  Company's  annual  meeting  of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company's references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.

## Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales  and  operating  expenses.  The  timing  of  product  introductions  can  also  impact  the  Company's  net  sales  to  its  indirect distribution  channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.

During the first quarter of 2025, the Company announced the following product updates:

- MacBook Pro ®
- Mac mini ®
- iMac ®
- iPad mini ®

## Macroeconomic Conditions

Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

|                                   | December 28, 2024    | December 30, 2023    |

The Company will adopt ASU 2024-03 in its fourth quarter of 2028 using a prospective transition method.

## Income Taxes

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ('ASU 2023-09'), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company  to  disaggregate  its  income  taxes  paid  disclosure  by  federal,  state  and  foreign  taxes,  with  further  disaggregation required  for  significant  individual  jurisdictions.

## PART II  -  OTHER INFORMATION

## Item 1. Legal Proceedings

## Digital Markets Act Investigations

On  March  25,  2024,  the  Commission  announced  that  it  had  opened  two  formal  noncompliance  investigations  against  the Company under the European Union ('EU') Digital Markets Act (the 'DMA'). The Commission's investigations concern (1) Article 5(4)  of  the  DMA,  which  relates  to  how  developers  may  communicate  and  promote  offers  to  end  users  for  apps  distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which  relates  to  default  settings,  uninstallation  of  apps,  and  a  web  browser  choice  screen  on  iOS.  On  June  24,  2024,  the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company's App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company's  new  contractual  requirements  for  third-party  app  developers  and  app  marketplaces  may  violate  the  DMA.  If  the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company's annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission's order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.

## Department of Justice Lawsuit

On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the 'DOJ') and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust  lawsuit  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  New  Jersey  against  the  Company  alleging  monopolization  or attempted monopolization in the markets for 'performance smartphones' and 'smartphones' in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.

## Epic Games

Epic Games, Inc. ('Epic') filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the 'California District Court') against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based upon the Company's operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company's App Store  Review  Guidelines  violate  California's  unfair  competition  law  and  issued  an  injunction  enjoining  the  Company  from prohibiting  developers  from  including  in  their  apps  external  links  that  direct  customers  to  purchasing  mechanisms  other  than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS ®  App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District  Court.  A  motion  by  Epic  disputing  the  Company's  compliance  plan  and  seeking  to  enforce  the  injunction,  which  the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.

## Other Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the  aggregate  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  condition  or  operating  results.  The  outcome  of  litigation  is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

## Item 1A. Risk Factors

The Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors,  whether  currently  known  or  unknown,  including  those  described  in  Part  I,  Item  1A  of  the 2024  Form  10-K  under  the heading 'Risk Factors.' When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company's risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K.

## The  Company  is  subject  to  complex  and  changing  laws  and  regulations  worldwide,  which  exposes  the  Company  to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company's business.

The Company's global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and  technology;  product  liability;  intellectual  property  ownership  and  infringement;  digital  platforms;  machine  learning  and artificial  intelligence;  internet,  telecommunications  and  mobile  communications;  media,  television,  film  and  digital  content; availability  of  third-party  software  applications  and  services;  labor  and  employment;  anticorruption;  import,  export  and  trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti-money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; national security; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.

Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company's business by increasing the Company's costs, limiting the  Company's ability to  offer  a  product,  service  or  feature  to  customers,  imposing  changes  to  the  design  of  the  Company's products  and  services,  impacting  customer  demand  for  the  Company's  products  and  services,  and  requiring  changes  to  the Company's  business  or  supply  chain.  New  and  changing  laws,  regulations,  executive  orders,  directives,  and  enforcement priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.

Risks  and  costs  related  to  new  and  changing  laws,  regulations,  executive  orders,  directives,  and  enforcement  priorities  may increase  as  the  Company's  products  and  services  are  introduced  into  specialized  applications,  including  health  and  financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company's  employees,  contractors  or  agents  will  not  violate  such  laws  and  regulations  or  the  Company's  policies  and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company's business may be announced with little or no  advance  notice  and  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to  effectively  mitigate  all  adverse  impacts  from  such  measures.  For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company's products  could  be  banned,  delayed  or  prohibited  from  importation,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

## The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.

From  time  to  time,  the  Company  has  made  changes  to  its  App  Store,  including  actions  taken  in  response  to  litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.

The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for  iOS  and  iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces ('APIs') for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Although the Company's compliance plan is intended to address the DMA's obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.

The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result  in  legal  proceedings  and  claims  against  the  Company  that  could,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  have  a  materially adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject to  civil  antitrust  lawsuits  in  the  U.S.  alleging  monopolization  or  attempted  monopolization  in  the  markets  for  'performance smartphones'  and  'smartphones'  generally  in  violation  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws.  In  addition,  the  Company  is  the  subject  of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject  to  investigations  and  litigation  that,  if  resolved  against  those  other  companies,  could  materially  adversely  affect  the Company's  commercial  relationships  with  those  business  partners  and  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's  business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC ('Google') and other companies to offer their search services on the Company's platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024, Google was found  to  have  violated  U.S.  antitrust  laws.  In  connection  with  this  finding,  the  DOJ  has  proposed  remedies,  which  include changes to Google's products, services and business models. The proposed changes vary in scope and severity and range from imposing significant restrictions on Google's licensing agreements to prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for search distribution for up to 10 years. If implemented, such remedies could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to earn revenue from such licensing arrangements.

There can be no assurance the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company's business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal  proceedings  can  negatively  impact  the  reputation  of  the  Company's  products  for  privacy  and  security  and  otherwise adversely  affect  the  experience  for  users  of  the  Company's  products  and  services,  and  result  in  harm  to  the  Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, lost sales, and lower profit margins.

## APPLE INC. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

(As Amended as of November 6, 2024)

This  Apple  Inc.  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  (as  it  may  be  amended  from  time  to time, the 'Plan') as amended and restated on March 10, 2015 (the 'Effective Date') and as  further  amended  by  the  Board  on  November  6,  2024  shall  govern  all  grants  of Options as to which Shares are to be delivered under the Plan.

- (1) Purpose  of  the  Plan.    The  purpose  of  the  Plan  is  to  encourage  and  enable Eligible  Employees  of  the  Company  and  certain  of  its  Subsidiaries  to  acquire proprietary interests in the Company through the ownership of Shares.  It is the intention of the Company to have this Plan and the Options granted pursuant to this Plan satisfy the requirements for 'employee stock purchase plans' that are set  forth  under  Section  423  of  the  Code,  although  the  Company  makes  no undertaking to, nor representation that it will, maintain the qualified status of this Plan or such Options.  In addition, Options that do not satisfy the requirements for 'employee stock purchase plans' that are set forth under Section 423 of the Code may be granted under this Plan pursuant to the rules, procedures, or subplans adopted by the Board for Eligible Employees.
- (2) Definitions.  Unless otherwise provided in the Plan, capitalized terms, when used herein, shall have the following respective meanings:
3. (a) 'Account' shall mean  a  bookkeeping account established and maintained  to  record  the  amount  of  funds  accumulated  pursuant  to the  Plan  with  respect  to  a  Participant  for  the  purpose  of  purchasing Shares under this Plan.
4. (b) 'Administrator' shall mean the Board, the People and Compensation Committee  of  the  Board,  or  any  other  committee  appointed  by  the Board.

6. (d) 'Board' shall mean the Company's Board of Directors.

- (g) 'Company' shall mean Apple Inc., a California corporation.
- (h) 'Designated Subsidiaries' shall mean any Subsidiary designated by the  Administrator  from  time  to  time,  in  its  sole  discretion,  whose employees may participate in the Plan, if such employees otherwise qualify as Eligible Employees.  The Administrator may provide that the non-U.S. Eligible Employees of any Designated Subsidiary shall only be eligible to participate in the Non-423(b) Offering.
- (i) 'Eligible  Compensation' shall  mean  and  refer  to  the  Participant's cash  compensation  paid  through  the  Company's  or  a  Designated Subsidiary's payroll system for personal services actually rendered in the course of employment.  Eligible Compensation shall be limited to amounts  received  by  the  Participant  during  the  period  he  or  she  is participating  in  the  Plan  and  includes  salary  and  other  wages, amounts contributed by the Participant to any benefit plan maintained by the Company or any Designated Subsidiary (including any 401(k) plan,  125  plan,  or  any  other  deferred  compensation  plan),  overtime pay,  commissions, draws against commissions, shift premiums, sick pay,  vacation  pay,  holiday  pay,  and  shutdown  pay,  except  to  the extent that the exclusion of any such item (or a sub-set of any such item)  is  specifically  directed  by  the  Administrator  for  all  Eligible Employees.    Notwithstanding  the  preceding,  Eligible  Compensation does not include any incentive or other bonus payments (unless the inclusion  of  any  incentive  or  other  bonus  payment  is  specifically directed by the Administrator for all Eligible Employees), remuneration paid in a form other than cash, fringe benefits (including car allowances and relocation  payments),  employee  discounts,  expense reimbursement or allowances, long-term disability payments, worker's compensation payments, welfare benefits, and any contributions that the Company or any Designated Subsidiary makes to any benefit plan (including any 401(k) plan or any other welfare or retirement plan).
- (j) 'Eligible  Employee' shall  mean  any  natural  person,  including  an officer, who is regularly employed by the Company or any Designated Subsidiary.
- (k) 'Enrollment Agreement' means the agreement(s) between the Company  and  an  Eligible  Employee,  in  such  written,  electronic,  or other  format  and/or  pursuant  to  such  written,  electronic,  or  other process as may be established by the Administrator from time to time, pursuant  to  which  an  Eligible  Employee  elects  to  participate  in  this

Plan or elects to make changes with respect to such participation as permitted by this Plan.

- (l) 'Enrollment Period' shall mean that period of time prescribed by the Administrator, which period shall conclude prior to the Offering Date, during  which  Eligible  Employees  may  elect  to  participate  in  an Offering Period.  The duration and timing of Enrollment Periods may be changed or modified by the Administrator from time to time.
- (m) 'Fair  Market  Value' shall  mean,  unless  otherwise  determined  or provided by the Administrator in the circumstances, the closing price (in  regular  trading)  for  a  Share  of  Common  Stock  on  the  NASDAQ Stock Market (the 'Market') for the date in question or, if no sales of Common Stock  were  reported  on  the  Market  on  that  date,  the  last price (in regular trading) for a Share of Common Stock on the Market for  the  next  preceding  day  on  which  sales  of  Common  Stock  were reported  on  the  Market.    The  Administrator  may,  however,  provide with respect to one or more Options that the Fair Market Value shall equal the last price for a Share of Common Stock on the Market on the last Trading Day preceding the date in question or the average of the high and low trading prices of a Share of Common Stock on the Market for the date in question or the most recent Trading Day.  If the Common Stock is no longer listed or is no longer actively traded on the  Market  as  of  the  applicable  date,  the  Fair  Market  Value  of  the Common Stock shall be the value as reasonably determined by the Administrator  for  purposes  of  the  Plan  in  the  circumstances.    The Administrator also may adopt a different methodology for determining Fair Market Value with respect to one or more Options if a different methodology  is  necessary  or  advisable  to  secure  any  intended favorable tax, legal, or other treatment for the particular Option(s) (for example,  and  without  limitation,  the  Administrator  may  provide  that Fair Market Value for purposes of one or more Options will be based on an average of closing prices (or the average of high and low daily trading prices) for a specified period preceding the relevant date).
- (n) 'Non-423(b) Offering' shall mean the rules, procedures, or sub-plans, if any, adopted by the Administrator as a part of this Plan, pursuant to which  Options  that  do  not  satisfy  the  requirements  for  'employee stock  purchase  plans'  that  are  set  forth  under  Section  423  of  the Code may be granted to  Eligible  Employees  as  a  separate  offering under the Plan.
- (o) 'Offering  Date' shall  mean  the  first  business  day  of  each  Offering Period as designated by the Administrator.
- (p) 'Offering Period' shall mean the period established in advance by the Administrator, which period shall not exceed  twenty-seven  (27) months, during which payroll deductions shall be collected to purchase  Shares  pursuant  to  an  offering  made  under  this  Plan.

Unless otherwise established by the Administrator prior to the start of an  Offering  Period,  there  shall  be  two  (2)  Offering  Periods  that commence  each  year,  and  each  shall  be  of  approximately  six  (6) months' duration, with the first such Offering Period beginning on the first business day of February and ending on the last business day of the immediately following July, and the second such Offering Period beginning on the first business day of August and ending on the last business day of the immediately following January; provided, however,  that  as  of  the  Effective  Date  and  subject  to  shareholder approval as of such date, this Plan shall apply to the Offering Period beginning on the first business day of February, 2015.

- (q) 'Option' shall  mean  the  right  granted  to  Participants  to  purchase Shares pursuant to an offering made under this Plan.
- (r) ' Outstanding Election' shall mean a Participant's then-current election to purchase Shares in an Offering Period, or that part of such an  election  which  has  not  been  cancelled  (including  any  voluntary cancellation under Section (9) and deemed cancellation under Section (14))  prior  to  the  close  of  business  on  the  last  Trading  Day  of  the Offering Period or such other date as determined by the Administrator.
- (s) 'Participant' shall  mean  an  Eligible  Employee  who  has  elected  to participate in the Plan pursuant to Section (6).
- (t) 'Prior  Plan' shall  mean  the  Apple  Inc.  Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan, as amended and restated effective as of March 8, 2010.
- (u) 'Purchase  Price  Per  Share' shall  mean  the  price  determined  or provided  by  the  Administrator  in  the  circumstances  but  shall  not  be less than the lesser of (i) eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value on the Offering Date or (ii) eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value on the last Trading Day of the Offering Period.
- (v) 'Share' shall mean one (1) share of Common Stock.
- (w) 'Subsidiary' shall mean any corporation (other than the Company) in an  unbroken  chain  of  corporations  beginning  with  the  Company  if each  of  the  corporations  other  than  the  last  corporation  in  the unbroken chain owns stock possessing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock in one of the other corporations in such chain.  A corporation that attains the status of a Subsidiary on a date after the Effective Date shall be considered a Subsidiary commencing as of such date.
- (x) 'Termination  of  Service' means,  with  respect  to  an  employee,  a cessation of the employee-employer relationship between the employee  and  the  Company  or  a  Designated  Subsidiary  for  any reason, (i) including but not by way of limitation, (A) a termination by

resignation, discharge, death, disability, retirement, or the disaffiliation of  a  Subsidiary,  (B)  unless  otherwise determined or provided by the Administrator, a transfer of employment to a Subsidiary that is not a Designated  Subsidiary  as  of  the  first  day  immediately  following  the three (3)-month period following such transfer, and (C) a termination of  employment  where  the  individual  continues  to  provide  certain services to the Company or a Subsidiary in a non-employee role, but (ii)  excluding  (A)  such  termination  where  there  is  a  simultaneous reemployment by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary and (B) any  bona  fide  and  Company-approved  leave  of  absence,  such  as family leave, medical  leave,  personal  leave,  and  military leave; provided,  however,  where  the  period  of  leave  exceeds  three  (3) months and the employee's right to reemployment is not guaranteed either  by  statute  or  by  contract,  the  employee-employer  relationship will  be  deemed  to  have  terminated  on  the  first  day  immediately following such three (3)-month period.

- (y) 'Trading Day' shall  mean a day on which the NASDAQ is open for trading.
- (3) Shares Reserved for the Plan.  Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section (17), the  maximum  number  of  Shares  that  may  be  delivered  pursuant  to  Options granted under this Plan (including any Non-423(b) Offering established hereunder) shall equal the sum of (i) 50,000,000 Shares and (ii) the number of Shares previously reserved for issuance under the Prior Plan but not delivered pursuant to Options as of the Effective Date; provided that in no event shall the maximum  number  of  Shares  reserved  for  issuance  under  the  Plan  exceed 57,591,146  Shares  (which  is  the  sum  of  (x)  the  50,000,000  Shares  set  forth above, plus (y) the number of Shares available for issuance under the Prior Plan on November 13, 2014).  The Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to this Plan may be authorized but unissued Shares, treasury Shares, or Shares purchased on the open market.  If any Option granted under the Plan shall for any reason terminate without having been exercised, the Shares not purchased under such Option shall again become available for issuance under the Plan.

If  the  number  of  Shares  to  be  purchased by Participants on the last day of an Offering  Period  exceeds  the  total  number  of  Shares  then  available  under  the Plan, then the Administrator shall make a pro-rata allocation of any Shares that may be issued pursuant to the Plan in as uniform and equitable a manner as is reasonably practicable, as determined in the Administrator's sole discretion.  In such event, the Company shall provide written notice to each affected Participant of the reduction of the number of Shares to be purchased under the Participant's Option.

If the Administrator determines that some or all of the Shares to be purchased by Participants  on  the  last  day  of  an  Offering  Period  would  not  be  issued  in accordance with Applicable Laws or any approval by any regulatory body as may be required, or the Shares would not be issued pursuant to an effective Form S-8 registration statement or that the issuance of some or all of such Shares pursuant

to  a  Form  S-8  registration  statement  is  not  advisable  due  to  the  risk  that  such issuance will violate Applicable Laws, the Administrator may, without Participant consent,  terminate  any  outstanding  Offering  Period  and  the  Options  granted pursuant  thereto  and  refund  in  cash  all  affected  Participants'  entire  Account balances for such Offering Period as soon as practicable thereafter.

In the Administrator's discretion, fractional Shares may be issuable upon exercise of the Options under the Plan.

- (4) Administration  of  the  Plan.    The  Administrator  shall  have  the  authority  and responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the Plan, which, to the extent permitted by the laws of the State of California and applicable U.S. Federal laws, it  may delegate to a sub-committee.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have full authority, in its sole discretion, to take any actions it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, including, but not limited to:
2. (a) Interpreting  the  Plan  and  prescribing,  adopting,  and  rescinding  rules and regulations it deems appropriate to implement the Plan, including amending  any  outstanding  Option,  as  it  may  deem  advisable  or necessary  to  comply  with  Applicable  Laws,  and  making  all  other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan;
3. (b) Establishing the timing and length of Offering Periods;
4. (c) Establishing minimum and maximum contribution rates;
5. (d) Establishing new or changing existing limits on the number of Shares an  Eligible  Employee  may  elect  to  purchase  with  respect  to  any Offering Period, if such limits are announced prior to the first Offering Period to be affected;
6. (e) Adopting  such  rules  or  sub-plans  as  may  be  deemed  necessary  or appropriate to comply with the laws of other countries, allow for taxpreferred  treatment  of  the  Options  or  otherwise  provide  for  the participation by Eligible Employees who reside outside of the United States, including determining which Eligible Employees are eligible to participate in the Non-423(b) Offering or other sub-plans established by the Administrator; and
7. (f) Establishing  the  exchange  ratio  applicable  to  amounts  withheld  in  a currency other than U.S. dollars and permitting payroll withholding in excess of the amount designated by a Participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in the processing of properly completed Enrollment Agreements.

The  Administrator's  determinations  under  the  Plan  shall  be  final, conclusive, and binding on all persons.  Neither the Board, the People and  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board,  any  other  committee appointed by the Board, nor any of their agents or designees shall be

liable  for  any  act,  failure  to  act,  or  determination  made  in  good  faith with respect to the Plan.

- (5) Grant of Option; Limitations.
2. (a) Grant  of  Option.    On  each  Offering  Date,  each  Participant  shall automatically be granted an Option to purchase as many Shares (or, as applicable, fractions of a Share) as the Participant will be able to purchase  with  the  payroll  deductions  credited  to  the  Participant's Account during the applicable Offering Period.
3. (b) Limit on Number of Shares Purchased.  Notwithstanding the above, in no event may a Participant purchase more than one million (1,000,000)  Shares  in  any  one  Offering  Period,  unless  otherwise expressly  provided  by  the  Administrator  in  advance  of  that  Offering Period.
4. (c) Limit on Value of Shares Purchased.  Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, excluding Options granted pursuant to any Non-423(b)  Offering,  no  Participant  shall  be  granted  an  Option  to purchase Shares under this Plan which permits the Participant's rights to purchase Shares under all 'employee stock purchase plans' (described in Section 423 of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to accrue at a rate which exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) of the Fair Market Value of such Shares (determined at the time such Options are granted) for each calendar year in which such Options are outstanding at any time.
5. (d) 5% Owner Limit.  Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the contrary,  no  Participant  shall  be  granted  an  Option  to  purchase Shares under this Plan if such Participant (or any other person whose stock  would  be  attributed  to  such  Participant  pursuant  to  Section 424(d) of the Code), immediately after such Option is granted, would own or hold options to purchase Shares possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
6. (e) Other Limitation.  The Administrator may determine, as to any Offering Period, that the offering will not be extended to 'highly compensated employees' within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code.
- (6) Participation in the Plan.  An Eligible Employee may become a Participant for an Offering Period by completing the prescribed Enrollment  Agreement  and submitting  such  Enrollment  Agreement  to  the  Company  (or  the  Company's designee),  in  the  format  and  pursuant  to  the  process  as  prescribed  by  the Administrator,  during  the  Enrollment  Period  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the Offering Period to which it relates.  Such Enrollment Agreement shall contain the payroll  deduction  authorization  described  in  Section  (8).    A  payroll  deduction authorization will be effective for the first Offering Period following the submission

of the Enrollment Agreement and all subsequent Offering Periods as provided by Section (7) until (i) it is terminated in accordance with Sections (9) or (14), (ii) it is modified by filing another Enrollment Agreement in accordance with this Section (6),  (iii)  an  election  is  made  to  decrease  payroll  deductions  in  accordance  with Section (8), (iv) the Participant's Termination of Service, or (v) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.

- (7) Automatic  Re-Enrollment.    Following  the  end  of  each  Offering  Period,  each Participant  shall  be  automatically  re-enrolled  in  the  next  Offering  Period  at  the applicable rate of payroll deductions in effect on the last Trading Day of the prior Offering  Period  or  otherwise  as  provided  under  Section  (8),  unless  (i)  the Participant has elected to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section (9), (ii)  the  Participant's  Termination  of  Service,  or  (iii)  the  Participant  is  otherwise ineligible to participate in the next Offering Period. Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the  Administrator  may  require  current  Participants  to  complete  and submit a new Enrollment Agreement at any time it deems necessary or desirable to facilitate Plan administration or for any other reason.
- (8) Payroll  Deductions.    Each  Participant's  Enrollment  Agreement  shall  contain  a payroll deduction authorization pursuant to which he or she shall elect to have a designated  whole  percentage  of  Eligible  Compensation  between  one  percent (1%) and ten percent (10%) deducted on each payday during the Offering Period and credited to the Participant's Account for the purchase of Shares pursuant to the offering.  Payroll deductions shall commence on the Offering Date of the first Offering  Period  to  which  the  Enrollment  Agreement  relates  (or  as  soon  as administratively  practicable  thereafter)  and  shall  continue  through  subsequent Offering Periods pursuant to Section (7).  Participants shall not be permitted to make any separate cash payments into their Account for the purchase of Shares pursuant  to  an  offering.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  local  law  prohibits payroll  deductions,  a  Participant  may  elect  to  participate  in  an  Offering  Period through contributions to his or her Account in a format and pursuant to a process acceptable  to  the  Administrator.    In  such  event,  any  such  Participant  shall  be deemed  to  participate  in a separate  offering  under  the  Plan,  unless  the Administrator otherwise expressly provides.

If  in  any payroll period a Participant has no pay or his or her pay is insufficient (after other authorized deductions) to permit deduction of the full amount of his or her  payroll  deduction  election,  then  (i)  the  payroll  deduction  election  for  such payroll period shall be reduced to the amount of pay remaining, if any, after all other authorized deductions, and (ii) the percentage or dollar amount of Eligible Compensation  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  reduced  by  the  amount  of  the reduction in the payroll deduction election for such payroll period.  Deductions of the full amount originally elected by the Participant will recommence as soon as his or her pay is sufficient to permit such payroll deductions; provided, however, no additional amounts will be deducted to satisfy the Outstanding Election.

A  Participant  may  elect  to  decrease,  but  not  increase,  the  rate  of  his  or  her payroll  deductions  during  an  Offering  Period  by  submitting  the  prescribed Enrollment Agreement to the Company (or the Company's designee) at any time

prior to the first day of the last calendar month of such Offering Period.  Any such payroll deduction change will be effective as soon as administratively practicable thereafter and will remain in effect for successive Offering Periods as provided in Section (7) unless (i) the Participant submits a new Enrollment Agreement for a later  Offering  Period,  (ii)  the  Participant  elects  to  decrease  his  or  her  payroll deductions, (iii) the Participants elects to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with  Section  (9),  (iv)  the  Participant  is  withdrawn  from  the  Plan  in  accordance with Section (14), or (v) the Participant is otherwise ineligible to participate in the Plan.  A Participant may only increase his or her rate of payroll deductions to be effective for the next Offering Period by completing and filing with the Company a new Enrollment Agreement authorizing the payroll deductions.

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Company  may  adjust  a  Participant's  payroll deductions  at  any  time  during  an  Offering  Period  to  the  extent  necessary  to comply  with  Section  423(b)(8)  of  the  Code  and  the  limitations  of  Section  (5). Payroll  deductions  will  recommence  and  be  made  in  accordance  with  the Outstanding Election in place prior to such Company adjustment starting with the first Offering Period that begins in the next calendar year (or such other time as is determined by the Administrator) unless (i) the Participant withdraws in accordance  with  Section  (9),  (ii)  the  Participant  is  withdrawn  from  the  Plan  in accordance  with  Section  (14),  or  (iii)  the  Participant  is  otherwise  ineligible  to participate in the Plan.

- (9) Withdrawal from Offering Period After Offering Date.  An Eligible Employee may withdraw from any Offering Period after the applicable Offering Date, in whole but not in part, at any time prior to the date specified by the Administrator or, if no such date is specified by the Administrator, the last Trading Day of such Offering Period,  by  submitting  the  prescribed  withdrawal  notice  to  the  Company  (or  the Company's designee), in the format and pursuant to the process as prescribed by  the  Administrator.    If  a  Participant  withdraws  from  an  Offering  Period,  the Participant's Option for such Offering Period will automatically be terminated, and the Company will refund in cash the Participant's entire Account balance for such Offering Period as soon as practicable thereafter.  A Participant's withdrawal from a  particular  Offering  Period  shall  be  irrevocable.    If  a  Participant  wishes  to participate in a subsequent Offering Period, he or she must re-enroll in the Plan by timely submitting a new Enrollment Agreement in accordance with Section (6).
- (10) Purchase  of  Stock.    On  the  last  Trading  Day  of  each  Offering  Period,  the Administrator shall cause the amount credited to each Participant's Account to be applied  to  purchase  as  many  Shares  (or,  as  applicable,  fractions  of  a  Share) pursuant to the Participant's Option as possible at the Purchase Price Per Share, subject  to  limitations  of  Sections  (3)  and  (5).    In  no  event  may  Shares  be purchased pursuant to an Option more than twenty-seven (27) months after the Offering Date of such Option.  The amount applied to purchase Shares pursuant to  the  Option  shall  be  deducted  from  the  Participant's  Account.    Any  amounts remaining  credited  to  the  Participant's  Account  on  the  last  Trading  Day  of  the Offering Period shall be retained in the Participant's Account and rolled forward to the next Offering Period.

- (11) Interest  on  Payments.    No  interest  shall  be  paid  on  sums  withheld  from  a Participant's  pay  for  the  purchase  of  Shares  under  this  Plan  unless  otherwise determined necessary by the Administrator.
- (12) Rights as Shareholder.  A Participant will not be a shareholder or have any rights as  a  shareholder  with  respect  to  Shares  subject  to  the  Participant's  Options issued under the Plan until the Shares are purchased pursuant to the Options and such Shares are transferred into the Participant's name on the Company's books and records.
- (13) Options Not Transferable.  A Participant's Options under this Plan may not be sold,  pledged,  assigned,  or  transferred  in  any  manner.    If  a  Participant  sells, pledges, assigns, or transfers his or her Options in violation of this Section (13), such Options shall immediately terminate, and the Participant shall immediately receive a refund of the amount then credited to the Participant's Account.
- (14) Deemed Cancellations.
5. (a) Termination of Service.  In the event of a Participant's Termination of Service,  (i)  any  outstanding  Option  held  by  the  Participant  shall immediately terminate; (ii) the Participant shall be withdrawn from the Plan; and (iii) the Participant shall receive a refund of the amount then credited to the Participant's Account.
6. (b) Death of a Participant.  If a Participant dies, (i) any outstanding Option held  by  the  Participant  shall  immediately  terminate,  and  (ii)  the Participant shall be withdrawn from the Plan. As soon as administratively  practicable  after  the  Participant's  death,  the  amount then  credited  to  the  Participant's  Account  shall  be  remitted  to  the executor, administrator, or other legal representative of the Participant's  estate  or,  if  the  Administrator  permits  a  beneficiary designation,  to  the  beneficiary  or  beneficiaries  designated  by  the Participant if such designation has been filed with the Company or the Company's  designee  before such Participant's death. If such executor, administrator, or other legal representative of the Participant's estate has not been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company) or if the beneficiary or beneficiaries are no longer living at the time of the Participant's death, the Company, in its discretion, may deliver the outstanding Account balance to the spouse or to any one or  more  dependents  or  relatives  of  the  Participant  or  to  such  other person as the Company may designate.
- (15) Application of Funds.  All funds received by the Company in payment for Shares purchased under this Plan and held by the Company at any time may be used for any valid corporate purpose.
- (16) No  Employment/Service Rights. Neither the action of the Company  in establishing the Plan, nor any action taken under the Plan by the Board or the Administrator,  nor  any  provision  of  the  Plan  itself,  shall  be  construed  so  as  to

grant  any  person  the  right  to  remain  in  the  employ  of  the  Company  or  any Subsidiary  for  any  period  of  specific  duration,  and  such  person's  employment may be terminated at any time, with or without cause.

- (17) Adjustments.  Subject to Section (18), upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any  merger,  combination,  consolidation,  or  other  reorganization;  any  spin-off, split-up, or similar extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Stock; or any exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any  similar,  unusual,  or  extraordinary  corporate  transaction  in  respect  of  the Common  Stock,  in  each  case,  then  the  Administrator  shall  equitably  and proportionately adjust (1) the number, amount, and type of Shares of Common Stock  (or  other  securities)  that  thereafter  may  be  made  the  subject  of  Options (including the specific Share limits, maximums, and numbers of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2) the number, amount, and type of Shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding Options, (3) the Purchase Price Per Share of any outstanding Options, and/or (4) the securities, cash, or other property deliverable upon exercise or payment of any outstanding Options, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by the Plan and the then-outstanding Options.

It  is  intended  that,  if  possible,  any  adjustments  contemplated  by  the  preceding paragraph  be  made  in  a  manner  that  satisfies  applicable  legal,  tax  (including, without  limitation  and  as  applicable  in  the  circumstances,  Section  424  of  the Code and Section 409A of the Code), and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.

Without limiting the generality of Section (4), any good faith determination by the Administrator  as  to  whether  an  adjustment  is  required  in  the  circumstances pursuant to this Section (17), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons.

- (18) Merger or Liquidation of Company.  In the event the Company or its shareholders enter  into  an  agreement  to  dispose  of  all  or  substantially  all  of  the  assets  or outstanding  capital  stock  of  the  Company  by  means  of  a  sale,  merger,  or reorganization in which the Company will not be the surviving corporation (other than  a  reorganization  effected  primarily  to  change  the  State  in  which  the Company  is  incorporated,  a  merger  or  consolidation  with  a  wholly-owned Subsidiary, or any other transaction in which there is no substantial change in the shareholders  of  the  Company  or  their  relative  stock  holdings,  regardless  of whether the Company is the surviving corporation) or in the event the Company is liquidated, then all outstanding Options under the Plan shall automatically be exercised immediately prior to the consummation  of such sale, merger, reorganization,  or  liquidation  (deemed  the  end  of  the  Offering  Period  in  such case) by causing all amounts credited to each Participant's Account to be applied to purchase as many Shares pursuant to the Participant's Option as possible at the Purchase Price Per Share, subject to the limitations of Sections (3) and (5).

- (19) Acquisitions and Dispositions.  The Administrator may, in its sole and absolute discretion  and  in  accordance  with  principles  under  Section  423  of  the  Code, create special Offering Periods for individuals who become Eligible Employees solely  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  of  another  company  or  business  by merger, reorganization, or purchase of assets, and notwithstanding Section (14), may  provide  for  special  purchase  dates  for  Participants  who  will  cease  to  be Eligible Employees solely in connection with the disposition of all or a portion of any Designated Subsidiary or a portion of the Company, which Offering Periods and  purchase  rights  granted  pursuant  thereto  shall,  notwithstanding  anything stated  herein,  be  subject  to  such  terms  and  conditions  as  the  Administrator considers appropriate in the circumstances.
- (20) Government Approvals or  Consents.    This  Plan  and  any  offering  and  sales  of Shares or delivery of Shares under this Plan to Eligible Employees hereunder are subject to any governmental or regulatory approvals or consents that may be or become applicable in connection therewith.
- (21) Plan Amendment, Suspension, and Termination.  The Board may, from time to time, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan in any manner it deems necessary or  advisable; provided, however, that no such action shall adversely affect any then  outstanding  and  vested  Options  under  the  Plan  unless  such  action  is required  to  comply  with  Applicable  Laws;  and  provided,  further,  that  no  such action  of  the  Board  shall  be  effective  without  the  approval  of  the  Company's shareholders  if  such  approval  is  required  by  Applicable  Laws.    Upon  the termination of the Plan, any balance in a Participant's Account shall be refunded to him or her as soon as practicable thereafter.
- (22) Governing Law.  The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California (except its choice-of-law provisions) and applicable U.S. Federal laws.

## APPLE INC. NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN

(as amended November 6, 2024)

On  November  13,  2017,  the  Board  adopted  this  Non-Employee  Director  Stock  Plan  (formerly known as the 1997 Director Stock Option Plan and the 1997 Director Stock Plan, and, as renamed, the 'Plan'), subject to approval by the Company's shareholders at the Annual Meeting on February 13, 2018. The Plan was further amended by the Board as set forth herein, effective November 6, 2024.  For the terms and conditions of the Plan applicable to an Award, refer to the version of the Plan in effect as of the date such Award was granted.

1. PURPOSES .  The purposes of the Plan are to retain the services of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company to serve as members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of the incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such individuals by granting such individuals Awards in respect of Shares.
2. ADMINISTRATION .  The Administrator shall be responsible for administering the Plan.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have the full authority, in its sole discretion, to take any actions it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, including but not limited to:
3. (a) determining the Fair Market Value for purposes of any Award;
4. (b) approving any forms of Award Agreements to be used under the Plan;
5. (c) amending any outstanding Awards;
6. (d) construing and interpreting the Plan and any agreements defining the rights and obligations of the Company and Non-Employee Directors under the Plan;
7. (e) correcting any defect, supplying any omission or reconciling any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award Agreement;
8. (f) adopting such rules or guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan;
9. (g) authorizing  any  person  to  execute  on  behalf  of  the  Company  any  instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously authorized by the Administrator or the Plan;
10. (h) adjusting the number of shares subject to any Award, adjusting the price of any or  all  outstanding  Options  or  otherwise  changing  previously  imposed  terms  and  conditions,  in such circumstances as the Administrator may deem appropriate;
11. (i) determining whether, and the extent to which, adjustments are required pursuant to Section 7 hereof; and
12. (j) making all other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan.

Each interpretation,  determination,  or  other  action  made  or  taken  by  the  Administrator  pursuant  to  the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, and the Administrator's determinations under the Plan need not  be  the  same  for  all  persons.    The  Administrator  shall  not  be  liable  for  any  action  or  determination made in good faith, and shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as such documents may be amended from time to time.

## 3. SHARES AVAILABLE; LIMITS .

(a) SHARE LIMIT .  Subject to the provisions of Section 7, the maximum number of Shares  that  may  be  issued  under  the  Plan  shall  not  exceed  11,200,000  Shares  (the  'Share Limit').  The stock issuable under the Plan shall be authorized and unissued Shares.

(b) SHARE COUNT .  Shares issued pursuant to Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall count against the Share Limit as two (2) Shares for every one (1) Share issued in connection with the Award.  Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Options shall count against the Share Limit as one (1) Share for every one (1) Share to which such exercise relates.  If Awards are settled in cash, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no cash settlement shall not be counted against the Share Limit.  Except as provided in the next sentence, if Awards are forfeited or are terminated for any reason before settlement or exercise, then the Shares underlying such Awards shall again become available for Awards under the Plan, provided that any one (1) Share subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award that is forfeited or terminated shall be credited as two (2) Shares when determining the number of Shares that shall again become available for Awards under  the  Plan.    Shares  that  are  exchanged  by  a  Non-Employee  Director  or  withheld  by  the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any Award under the Plan, as well as any Shares  exchanged  by  a  Non-Employee  Director  or  withheld  by  the  Company  or  one  of  its Subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any Award, shall not be available for subsequent Awards under the Plan.

(c) LIMIT ON COMPENSATION. In no event shall the compensation payable by the Company  to  a  Non-Employee  Director  for  services  performed  as  a  Non-Employee  Director, including the grant date value (determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) of Awards, cash retainers, and other compensation, exceed $1,500,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year.

4. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS .    Unless  otherwise  determined  by  the  Administrator,  each  NonEmployee Director shall receive grants of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan subject to the following provisions of this Section 4 and the terms of any Award Agreement approved by the Administrator:

(a) ANNUAL GRANTS .  On the date of each Annual Meeting immediately following which a Non-Employee Director is serving on the Board, such Non-Employee Director shall be automatically granted an Award of a number of Restricted Stock Units determined by dividing (i) $310,000 (or such other amount as determined by the Board and subject to the limitations of the Plan) by (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an 'Annual RSU Award').

(b) INITIAL  GRANTS .    Each  Non-Employee  Director  who  first  becomes  a  NonEmployee Director at any time other than on the date of an Annual Meeting shall be automatically granted, on the date he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director, an Award of a number of Restricted  Stock  Units  determined  by  multiplying  (i)  the  quotient  obtained  by  dividing  (A)  the dollar  amount  applied  under  Section  4(a)  with  respect  to  Awards  granted  at  the  immediately preceding Annual Meeting by (B) the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant, by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the number of days remaining in the 365-day period following the most recent Annual Meeting, and (B) the denominator of which shall be 365 (but in no event shall such fraction be greater than one (1)), such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number of Restricted Stock Units (each, an 'Initial RSU Award'); provided, however, that a Non-Employee Director shall not be eligible to receive an Initial RSU Award if either (x) he or she was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to first becoming a Non-Employee Director, or (y) he or she first becomes a Non-Employee Director at any time on or after the February 1 following the last preceding Annual Meeting.

- (c) VESTING;  TERMINATION  OF  SERVICE .    Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  an Award Agreement at the time of grant, each Annual RSU Award shall fully vest on the February 1 that occurs in the fiscal year of the Company following the fiscal year in which the Award was granted.  Each Initial RSU Award shall fully vest on the Vesting Date established for the Annual RSU Awards granted in connection with the last Annual Meeting to occur prior to the grant date of such Initial RSU Award.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board for  any  reason  other  than  the  Non-Employee  Director's  death,  the  Non-Employee  Director's Restricted Stock Units shall terminate to the extent such Restricted Stock Units have not become vested prior to the first date the Non-Employee Director is no longer a member of the Board, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to, or in respect of, such terminated Restricted Stock Units.  If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board due to his or her death, the Non-Employee Director's unvested Restricted Stock Units shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director's death.
- (d) SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS . On or as soon as administratively practical following the applicable Vesting Date (and in all events not later than two  and  one-half  months  after  the  applicable  Vesting  Date),  the  Company  shall  deliver  to  the Non-Employee Director a number of Shares (as evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of  the  Company  or  a  duly  authorized  transfer  agent  of  the  Company)  equal  to  the  number  of Restricted  Stock  Units  that  vested  on  the  applicable  Vesting  Date.    Upon  settlement  of  any Restricted  Stock  Units  in  accordance  with  the  foregoing  provision  of  this  Section  4(d)  and settlement of any Dividend Equivalent Right in accordance with Section 4(f), the Non-Employee Director shall have no further rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units that are so paid.
- (e) SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS .    A  Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no dividend rights (except as expressly set forth in Section 4(f) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such Restricted Stock Units until such Shares have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 4(d).  Except for any Dividend  Equivalent  Rights  awarded  pursuant  to  Section  4(f)  or  as  provided  in  Section  7,  no adjustment shall be made in respect of any Restricted Stock Units for dividends or distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record of Shares related thereto.
- (f) DIVIDEND  EQUIVALENT  RIGHTS  DISTRIBUTIONS .    As  of  any  date  that  the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Common Stock, the Company shall credit the Non-Employee Directors with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per Share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Common Stock on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Restricted Stock Units (including as such total number may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7) subject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior  to  the  record  date  for  that  dividend  (a  'Dividend Equivalent Right').  Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(f) shall be subject to the same vesting, settlement and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they relate; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash.  No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 4(f) with respect to any Restricted Stock Units which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 4(d) or terminated pursuant to Section 4(c).

## 5. OPTIONS.

(a) NO ADDITIONAL GRANTS .  No Options shall be granted under the Plan unless and until the Board determines that the grant of Options is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

(b) EXERCISE PRICE .  The per share exercise price of each Option shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date of grant of the Option determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.

(c) VESTING .  Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement at the time of grant, Options shall be fully vested and immediately exercisable on their date of grant.

- (d) TERM OF OPTIONS .
- i. TEN-YEAR TERM .  Each Option shall expire ten (10) years from its date of grant, subject to earlier termination as provided herein.
- ii. TERMINATION  OF  SERVICE .    Upon  cessation  of  a  Non-Employee  Director's service as a member of the Board for any reason other than death, any of the Non-Employee Director's Options (or any portion thereof) that is not then vested shall terminate, and the Non-Employee Director shall have no rights with respect to,  or  in  respect  of,  such  terminated  Options.    If  the  Non-Employee  Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board due to his or her death, the NonEmployee Director's Options shall fully vest as of the date of the Non-Employee Director's death.
- iii. EXERCISE  FOLLOWING  TERMINATIONS  OF  SERVICE .    If  a  Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason other than death, any Options granted to such Non-Employee Director that are exercisable at the time of the Non-Employee Director's termination may be exercised by such NonEmployee Director at any time within ninety (90) days after the date of such NonEmployee  Director's  termination  of  service,  subject  to  the  earlier  expiration  of such Options as provided for in Section 5(d)(i) above.  At the end of such ninetyday  period,  any  unexercised  portion  of  the  Option  shall  expire.    If  a  NonEmployee Director ceases to be a member of the Board by reason of his or her death, all of the Options granted to the Non-Employee Director may be exercised by his or her Beneficiary at any time within three (3) years after the date of the Non-Employee Director's death, subject to the earlier expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 5(d)(i) above.  At the end of such three-year period, any unexercised portion of the Option shall expire.
- (e) TIME AND MANNER OF EXERCISE OF OPTIONS .
- i. NOTICE  OF  EXERCISE .    Subject  to  the  other  terms  and  conditions  hereof,  a Non-Employee Director may exercise any Option, to the extent such Option is vested, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company; provided, however, that in no event shall an Option be exercisable for a fractional share.  The date of exercise of an Option shall be the later of (A) the date on which the Company receives  such  written  notice  and  (B)  the  date  on  which  the  Non-Employee Director pays the applicable consideration pursuant to Section 5(e)(ii).
- ii. METHOD OF EXERCISE .    The  consideration  to  be  paid  for  the  Shares  to  be issued upon exercise of an Option may consist of (A) cash, (B) check, (C) other Shares  that  have  a  Fair  Market  Value  on  the  date  of  surrender  equal  to  the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which the Option shall be exercised, (D)  delivery  of  a  properly  executed  exercise  notice  together  with  irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Shares and promptly deliver to the Company the amount of proceeds required to pay the exercise price, or (E) any combination of the  foregoing  methods  of  payment.    Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the

foregoing, any vested and exercisable Options may also be Net Exercised, to the extent permitted by the Administrator.

- iii. SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS .    A  Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares issuable upon exercise of an Option until such Shares shall have been issued to the Non-Employee Director pursuant to Section 5(e), and, except as provided in Section 7, no adjustment shall be made to an Option or Share issued upon  the exercise thereof for dividends, distributions or other rights in respect of any Share for which the record date is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become the holder of record thereof.
2. (f) ISSUANCE  OF  SHARES .    Subject  to  the  foregoing  conditions,  as  soon  as  is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of exercise and, if applicable, payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised,  the  Company  shall  deliver  to  the  Non-Employee  Director  (or  following  the  NonEmployee Director's death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be acceptable to the Company and the NonEmployee  Director  (or  such  Beneficiary),  the  appropriate  number  of  Shares  to  be  issued  in connection with such exercise.  Delivery of such Shares shall be evidenced by an appropriate entry on the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company, or in such  other  manner  that  the  Administrator  shall  specify  from  time  to  time.    Shares  sold  in connection  with  a  'cashless  exercise'  shall  be  delivered  to  the  broker  referred  to  therein  in accordance with procedures established by the Company from time to time.

6. RESTRICTIONS  ON  TRANSFER .    An  Award  may  not  be  transferred,  pledged,  assigned,  or otherwise disposed of, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that, with the approval of the Administrator, an Award may be transferred to a Non-Employee Director's family members or to one or more trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such family members.  An Option shall be exercisable, during the Non-Employee Director's lifetime, only by the Non-Employee  Director  or  by  the  individual  or  entity  to  whom  the  Option  has  been  transferred  in accordance  with  the  previous  sentence.    No  assignment  or  transfer  of  an  Award,  or  of  the  rights represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Award, but immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Award the same shall terminate and be of no force or effect.

## 7. ADJUSTMENTS .

(a) Upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any  reclassification,  recapitalization,  stock  split  (including  a  stock  split  in  the  form  of  a  stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, combination, consolidation or other reorganization; any  spin-off,  split-up,  split-off  or  extraordinary  dividend  distribution  in  respect  of  the  Common Stock;  or  any  exchange  of  Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Stock, the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1) the number and type of Shares (or other securities) that  thereafter  may  be  made the subject of Awards (including the Share Limit, maximums and number of Shares set forth elsewhere in the Plan), (2) the number, amount and type of Shares (or other  securities  or  property)  subject  to  any  outstanding  Awards,  (3)  the  exercise  price  of  any outstanding Options, and/or (4) the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or settlement of any outstanding Awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase)  the  level  of  incentives  intended  by  the  Plan  and  the  then-outstanding  Awards.    Any good  faith  determination  by  the  Administrator  as  to  whether  an  adjustment  is  required  in  the

circumstances pursuant to this Section 7(a), and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.

- (b) It  is  intended  that,  unless  otherwise  determined  by  the  Administrator,  any adjustments contemplated by Section 7(a) be made in a manner that satisfies applicable legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Code Section 409A) and accounting  (so  as  to  not trigger  any  charge  to  earnings  with  respect  to  such  adjustment) requirements.
- (c) Any adjustment  under  this  Section  7  need  not  be  the  same  for  all  persons  or Awards.

8. CHANGE OF CONTROL .  Upon the occurrence of any Change of Control, any then outstanding Award automatically shall become vested or exercisable, as the case may be, with respect to a prorated portion of the number of Shares subject to such Award, determined as follows:

- (a) CLIFF-VESTING AWARDS. If  the  Award has one scheduled Vesting Date, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control:  (i) the number of Shares subject to such Award, multiplied by (ii) a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from and including the date the Award was granted to the date of the Change of Control, and (B) the denominator is the number of days from and including the date of grant to and including the scheduled Vesting Date.
- (b) INSTALLMENT-VESTING  AWARDS. If  the  Award  has  multiple  scheduled Vesting Dates, the portion of the Award with respect to the following number of Shares shall vest upon the Change of Control:  (i) the number of Shares subject to the portion of such Award that is scheduled to vest on the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control,  multiplied  by  (ii)  a  fraction  (A)  the  numerator  of  which  is  the  number  of  days  elapsed following and excluding the most recent Vesting Date prior to the Change of Control, and (B) the denominator is the number of days from and excluding such most recent Vesting Date to and including the first Vesting Date that is scheduled to occur following the Change of Control.

(d) NO  REPRICING .    In  no  case  (except  due  to  an  adjustment  contemplated  by Section 7 or any repricing that may be approved by shareholders) shall any action be taken with respect to the Plan or any Option hereunder that would constitute a repricing (by amendment, substitution,  cancellation  and  regrant,  exchange  or  other  means,  including  any  action  that  is treated  as  a  repricing  under  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles)  of  the  per  Share exercise price of any Option.

## 11. MISCELLANEOUS .

(a) NO RIGHT TO NOMINATION .    Nothing  in  the  Plan  shall  be  deemed  to  create any  obligation  on  the  part  of  the  Board  to  nominate  any  of  its  members  for  reelection  by  the Company's  shareholders,  nor  confer  upon  any  Non-Employee  Director  the  right  to  remain  a member of the Board for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation.

(b) REGULATORY  REQUIREMENTS .    The  Administrator  may  require  each  NonEmployee Director or any other person purchasing or acquiring Shares pursuant to the Plan to agree with the Company in writing that such Non-Employee Director is acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof or provide such other assurances and representations to the Company as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements.  Shares delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem  advisable  under  the  rules,  regulations  and  other  requirements  of  the  Securities  and Exchange Commission or any exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed, and any applicable  federal  or  state  securities  law.

Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.

(g) AUTHORITY OF THE COMPANY AND SHAREHOLDERS .
