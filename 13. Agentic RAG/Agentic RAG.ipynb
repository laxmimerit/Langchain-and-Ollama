Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) also offer\\na plethora of benefits for consumers. As explained by Sanz et al. [7], BCAAs are stored\\ndirectly in muscles and serve as the raw materials needed to build new muscle. This\\ncontributes to the overall process of strengthening muscles and alleviating post-workout\\nsoreness. Consumers often integrate these supplements into their routines with the aim of\\noptimizing the outcomes they wish to achieve and support overall well-being [1].\\nThe sports supplement industry makes for an impressive market share of nearly\\n$12 billion in the health/wellness portfolio and is projected to be worth $24.4 billion\\nby 2025. In a study by Burke [4], which investigated 20 published studies about the\\nprevalence, methods, and reasons for supplement consumption, it is evident from the\\n\\nSource: rag-dataset\\\\health supplements\\\\3.health_supplements_side_effects.pdf (Page 7): appetite, body weight, and BMI after intake for 8 weeks (74). Accidental intake of \\nsupplements with DMAA, mainly in children, have caused relatively mild adverse effects \\nsuch as tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting (75). However, serious cardiovascular events after \\nDMAA intake have also been reported. Recreational use of DMAA in New Zealand has \\nbeen associated with cases of cerebral hemorrhage (76,77). Furthermore, there are three \\ncases of cardiac arrest occurring during physical exercise in the military and in a gym \\nfollowing intake of DMAA-containing supplements (71,78). Two of the events eventually \\nled to the deaths of US soldiers. While it cannot be proven that DMAA is the causative agent \\nfor all the adverse events, it is clear that DMAA does indeed have cardiovascular effects \\nsuch as vasoconstriction and elevation of blood pressure (79,80). Following receipt of 42 \\nadverse events reports on products with DMAA, the FDA in April 2012 sent warning letters\\n\\nSource: rag-dataset\\\\health supplements\\\\3.health_supplements_side_effects.pdf (Page 7): component of Geranium plants, e.g. as geranium extract (71). However, the presence of \\nDMAA in plants has not been verified, leading to the conclusion that DMAA in supplements \\nis generated by chemical synthesis (72). DMAA has further been banned as a performance \\nenhancing drug by the World Anti-Doping Agency (73). One version of the weight-loss \\nsupplement OxyELITE Pro from USPlabs, LLC contained the compound 1,3-\\ndimethylamylamine (DMAA) in addition to ingredients such as caffeine, Bauhinia purpurea, \\nBacopa monniera, Cirsium oligophyllum, and rauwolscine (Yohimbe) extract. Studies that \\nwere supported financially by USPlabs, LLC with a small number of healthy volunteers \\nsuggested that this supplement formulation could increase lipolysis, metabolic rate, heart \\nrate and systolic blood pressure in the short term (2 h) as well as lead to small decreases in \\nappetite, body weight, and BMI after intake for 8 weeks (74).

      "The sun is a star at the center of our solar system, composed primarily of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 25%), with trace amounts of heavier elements. It generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core, where hydrogen atoms fuse into helium, releasing vast amounts of light and heat. This process sustains the sun's luminosity and provides the energy necessary for life on Earth. The sun's surface temperature is approximately 5,500¬∞C (9,932¬∞F), while its core reaches temperatures of about 15 million¬∞C (27 million¬∞F). \n",

      "\n",
      "### **Sources and Types of Protein**\n",
      "1. **Dairy Proteins**:  \n",
      "   - Casein and whey proteins are common in protein powders, used by athletes and bodybuilders. These are also foundational in infant formulas, consumed by over 4 million U.S. infants annually (Page 3 of *3.health_supplements_side_effects.pdf*).  \n",
      "   - **Safety**: Dairy proteins generally have low toxicity but may cause allergies in individuals sensitive to cow‚Äôs milk protein. Excessive intake could lead to ketosis (Page 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Vegetable Proteins**:  \n",
      "   - Soy protein isolate (SPI) is a plant-based alternative, widely used in supplements (Page 3 of *3.health_supplements_side_effects.pdf*).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Whey Protein**:  \n",
      "   - Highlighted as a high-quality protein source with more essential amino acids than traditional options. It aids in muscle mass gain, recovery, and performance enhancement (Page 0 of *1. Analysis of Actual Fitness Supplement.pdf*).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Role in Health and Fitness**\n",
      "- **Athletic Use**:  \n",
      "  - Protein supplements (e.g., shakes, powders) are the most prevalent fitness products, with 43% of fitness center users consuming them (Page 4 of *2. High Prevalence of Supplement Intake.pdf*). Men are more likely to use them (62% vs. 35% in women) due to muscle and strength training goals (Page 4 of *2. High Prevalence of Supplement Intake.pdf*).  \n",
      "  - Average weekly intake: 17.1 servings (SD: 16.1), with 31% consuming over 20 servings and 10% exceeding 40 servings (Page 4 of *2. High Prevalence of Supplement Intake.pdf*).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Infant Nutrition**:  \n",

      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Considerations and Risks**\n",
      "- **Side Effects**:  \n",
      "  - While generally safe, excessive protein intake (e.g., from supplements) may cause ketosis. Dairy proteins could exacerbate anticoagulation risks when combined with blood thinners like warfarin (Page 3 of *3.health_supplements_side_effects.pdf*).  \n",
      "  - Soy protein may interact with certain medications, though specific risks are not detailed in the retrieved texts.\n",
