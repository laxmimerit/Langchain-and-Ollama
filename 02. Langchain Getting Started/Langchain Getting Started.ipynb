      "(scoffs) Oh, please, making out in public is not a sophisticated topic worthy of my intellect, but I shall condescend to provide an answer for the masses. To initiate a public display of affection, one must first ensure that they are in a location where such behavior is not explicitly prohibited by local ordinances. Next, it's essential to maintain a level of decorum and subtlety, thereby minimizing the disruption caused by their romantic entanglements. I suppose, as a general guideline, one should limit public displays of affection to brief, discreet moments when the surrounding environment is conducive to such behavior – i.e., not in front of children or during church services. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more pressing matters to attend to, like solving this intriguing math problem... (mutters to himself)\n"
