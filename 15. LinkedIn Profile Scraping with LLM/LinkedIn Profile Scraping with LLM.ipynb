The information is used to convey Smart Assistance to the user for their daily improved health care conditions thus improving their efficiency and longevity. We are offering sleep disorder monitoring devices. In addition to this, our business model is B2C and device will be directly available to the customer for purchase via online e-commerce stores as well as company e-store itself and the expected cost will be in between 110 to 149 dollar.\\nOptimized Fixed Point Kalman Filter Implementation on Embedded Hardware\\nAug 2013 - Apr 2014\\nReal time adaptive signal processing is an area of considerable interest for the researchers in the field of embedded signal processing. Owing to the large dynamic range and constant relative accuracy of floating point arithmetic, filters are traditionally realized in floating point data type. However, using floating point arithmetic in embedded systems lead to larger cost in terms of latency, power and memory. Therefore these algorithms need to be implemented in fixed point for optimizing these constraints. However with the reduction in the word length the precision get affected. Therefore these algorithms need to be coded properly with adequate fixed point format such that precision is not affected while the resources are optimized. In this thesis an attempt has been made to implement Least Mean Square (LMS), Recursive Least Square (RLS) and Kalman Filtering algorithms on ARM Cortex M0+ with Thumb instruction set. The word length has been optimized for accurate performance, reduced power, improved speed and reduced memory usage. The validation of the algorithm has been carried out with respect to MATLAB.\\nShow all 5 projects\\n',\n",
